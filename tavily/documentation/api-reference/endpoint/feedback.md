# Feedback

> Submit feedback on how relevant and useful Tavily's results were for your task.

<Warning>
  **Beta.** This endpoint is in beta: the request shape may still change, and it may be
  temporarily unavailable during maintenance. Submit feedback on a best-effort basis —
  send it asynchronously, treat a failure as non-fatal, and never block your agent on the
  response.
</Warning>

Feedback tells Tavily how useful its results actually were for your task. It is the signal
we use to improve ranking and result quality. Submitting feedback is free — it does not
consume [API credits](/documentation/api-credits).
