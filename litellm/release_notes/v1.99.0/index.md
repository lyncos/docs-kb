:::note

PyPI and Docker artifacts for this release were built from different SHAs, but are expected to be functionally the same. PyPI was built from [`d0c8667`](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/commit/d0c86678ed3c8951a2c47ed1b1fabcf8de65b553) and Docker from [`fa647f7`](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/commit/fa647f742d7baefe8eb1181899d9c81b41559772).

:::danger[Breaking Changes]

**Audit logging now defaults to on for proxies running an Enterprise license.** `store_audit_logs` becomes tri-state: unset plus a premium license resolves to enabled, replacing roughly fifteen scattered gate checks with one resolver, and `LITELLM_STORE_AUDIT_LOGS` is now honoured by the key hooks that previously ignored it. An enterprise proxy that never set the flag starts writing audit rows on upgrade, which will grow the audit table. Set `store_audit_logs: false` explicitly to keep the prior behavior. See [PR #37518](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/37518).

**Shadow eval jobs are budgeted in dollars instead of turns.** `POST /auto_router/shadow_eval/start` now takes `max_budget` in USD per key; a request that still sends `max_turns` gets a 422 naming the replacement. The sampler, sweep, stop guard, and derived status all gate on the billed `response_cost` of the shadow arm and the judge, and admission re-checks the proxy's cross-pod spend counter. Jobs created before the migration keep their configured turn budget, since `max_budget` stays NULL on those rows. See [PR #37555](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/37555).

**A shadow eval job now covers a list of keys rather than one.** `api_key_ids` replaces `api_key_id` on the start payload, results come back pooled and per key, and sibling rows are tied together by a new `group_id` column. A caller still sending the singular `api_key_id` must move to the list form. See [PR #37251](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/37251).

## Key Highlights

- **The Admin UI's migration off antd and Tremor is complete** - `@tremor/react`, `antd`, and `@ant-design/icons` are all removed from the dashboard's dependencies, with the last components, the shared primitives, and every form ported onto shadcn (base-vega) and react-hook-form. 130 UI pull requests land in this window, and the dashboard is now on React 19
- **Dark mode ships** - a light/dark/system toggle in the top bar, semantic status tokens for success, warning and info, a dark variant of the LiteLLM logo, and an admin-supplied dark variant of a custom logo. Hardcoded Tailwind palette classes across the dashboard are mapped onto theme tokens so surfaces, form controls, inline styles and code blocks all follow the theme
- **`lite login` is a real OAuth flow** - the CLI now authenticates with an authorization code plus PKCE against the proxy, stores the credential and the refresh token in the OS keychain rather than a `token.json` on disk, and `lite login --config-claude` wires Claude Code up at login
- **Batch spend is accounted for end to end** - enqueued-token rate limiting admits batches against a token budget and refunds on completion or cancellation, cost rows are claimed atomically so multi-pod polling cannot double-bill, cancelled and failed batches that still produced output are billed, a single undecodable output line no longer zeroes a batch's spend, and Bedrock batches can be cancelled through `POST /v1/batches/{id}/cancel`
- **Provisioned throughput can be declared in `config.yaml`** - a PTU reservation no longer has to be created through the API; the rollup accrues flat cost for config-declared deployments, refuses an incomplete reservation the way the endpoints do, requires an operator-declared id, and warns when a config declares PTU while attribution is switched off
- **The complexity router is operator-configurable** - operator-defined tier sets for the LLM classifier, custom classifier plugins via `classifier_type: custom`, a plan-mode tier floor for coding-agent clients, a business classification rubric preset, and per-model reasoning effort in the tier editor

| fal.ai | `fal_ai/gpt-image-2`, `fal_ai/openai/gpt-image-2` | - | - | - | Image generation and edit, priced per size and quality from request params |

The fal.ai entry expands to 57 registry keys: the two base slugs plus every `low`/`medium`/`high` quality crossed with six output resolutions, for both generation and `/edit`. The Fireworks entries each carry an `accounts/fireworks/models/` alias, and the two `glm-5p2-fast` and two `kimi-k3` fast/US variants also carry an `accounts/fireworks/routers/` alias, so the slug you already use keeps resolving.

Beyond the new entries, this release is another large cost-map maintenance pass over 288 existing entries. 219 entries gain or correct a provider-announced `deprecation_date`, 25 gain Batch API input and output rates alongside a `regional_endpoint_uplift_multiplier`, and 15 gain a `prompt_cache_min_tokens` floor, including 4096 on Gemini 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 Flash and 3.1 Pro Preview. Pricing moves in both directions: Gemini 3.6 Flash halves to $0.75 / $3.75 per 1M on both Gemini and Vertex, `gpt-5.6` and `gpt-5.6-sol` drop to $4.00 / $20.00 on a promotional cut, `mistral/codestral-latest` falls to $0.30 / $0.90 and Vertex DeepSeek V3.1 MaaS to $0.60 / $1.70, while `gemini-3.1-flash-image` doubles to $0.50 / $3.00 and `mistral/mistral-small-latest` rises to $0.15 / $0.60. The GPT-5.6 family's max input tokens is corrected from 1.05M to 922K across the Azure, US and EU entries. Flex and priority service-tier rates land on 8 and 5 entries respectively, `thinking_always_on` on 11, and `supports_prompt_cache_breakpoint` on 4. No pricing entries were removed.

## End-to-End Testing

We are investing heavily in end-to-end testing to cut regressions and make LiteLLM more stable release over release. Every version is exercised by a live suite that runs against a real deployed proxy and hits real provider endpoints, not mocks, so the behavior we validate is the behavior you get in production.

This window added 73 test-only pull requests, 14 of them touching the live e2e suite. The headline change is a record-and-replay transport seam: a fixture bundle format, canonical content-based match keys, query params and multipart form fields pinned as part of replay identity, and the seam moved down to the provider edge, so the non-streaming provider flows can be replayed deterministically while the live suite still runs against real providers. New permanent regressions pin prompt-cache, service-tier and cost-header billing, OpenAI passthrough routing and file-list isolation, the OpenAI WebSocket passthrough prefixes, and twelve previously closed issues.

The suite itself was hardened against the failures that were masking real signal: response-cache cross-talk, slow providers and single upstream blips are now tolerated deliberately rather than by luck, blind sleeps are replaced with deadline waits, and live suites were repointed off retired Gemini, Groq, Together AI and Vertex image models. On the ratchet side, six ruff rules now reject tests that cannot fail, `pytest.raises(Exception)` is banned outright, `PT011`/`PT012`/`PT014`/`PT017`/`RUF043` are enforced so a broad raises block cannot pass on the wrong error, and `F811` and `F821` are enforced so a duplicate or undefined name cannot silently replace the first. Thirty test files stranded in a second mirror now actually run, `tests/old_proxy_tests` was retired, and the conftest save/restore inventory is frozen so it can only shrink; the global-state cleanup unwound 182 leaking writes out of the cost-calc suites alone.
