:::info[Update: no performance regression found]

An earlier version of this note flagged a potential throughput regression. We investigated and could not confirm or reproduce any regression in the released version. The one report we received came from a deployment running custom code on top of what we shipped, and our testing points to those changes, not LiteLLM, as the likely cause.

Correctness and error rates were never affected. If you're on this version, there's nothing you need to do.

We're still monitoring incoming reports and will update this note if anything changes.

`v1.89.4` is a patch release on top of [`v1.89.3`](/release_notes/v1.89.3/v1-89-3). It streams OpenAI→Vertex batch JSONL uploads instead of buffering them in memory, backports cost-tracking recovery for interrupted Anthropic streams, adds a `no-mcp-servers` sentinel that scopes a key to zero MCP servers, and clears the remaining OSV-flagged CVEs with OpenSSL and dependency bumps. The bundled `litellm-enterprise` package is bumped to `0.1.42.post2`.
