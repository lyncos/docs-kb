:::info[Update: no performance regression found]

An earlier version of this note flagged a potential throughput regression. We investigated and could not confirm or reproduce any regression in the released version. The one report we received came from a deployment running custom code on top of what we shipped, and our testing points to those changes, not LiteLLM, as the likely cause.

Correctness and error rates were never affected. If you're on this version, there's nothing you need to do.

We're still monitoring incoming reports and will update this note if anything changes.

`v1.89.2` is a patch release on top of [`v1.89.1`](/release_notes/v1.89.1/v1-89-1). It hardens cost tracking around `service_tier`, corrects `/v1/models` listing for team and BYOK setups, and tightens vector-store access and OTEL error reporting.

### What's Changed

- fix(cost): stop a non-string `service_tier` from silently dropping cost tracking - [PR #30690](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/30690)
- fix(anthropic): price and surface the response `service_tier` in cost tracking - [PR #30558](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/30558)
- fix(proxy): list the public team model name in `/v1/models` - [PR #30588](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/30588)
- feat(proxy): add an opt-in `healthy_only` filter to `GET /v1/models` - [PR #30130](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/30130)
- fix(proxy): resolve list-files credentials from team BYOK deployments - [PR #30495](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/30495)
- fix(proxy): allow internal roles to access vector store CRUD routes - [PR #30503](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/30503)
- fix(otel): record the full error message on the standard exception event in OTEL v2 - [PR #30380](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/30380)
