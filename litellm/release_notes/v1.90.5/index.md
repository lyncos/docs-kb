`v1.90.5` is a patch release on top of [`v1.90.4`](/release_notes/v1.90.4/v1-90-4). It restores the `litellm-proxy-extras` source folder (the Prisma schema and its migrations catalog) in the runtime stage of all three published Docker images. Images from `v1.90.0` through `v1.90.4` dropped `/app/litellm-proxy-extras`, which broke deployments that run their own pre-deploy migration job against the schema and migrations shipped at that path; the breakage could be silent, because `prisma migrate deploy` pointed at a schema with no adjacent migrations directory exits 0 without applying anything. Images now match what `v1.89.x` and earlier contained.
