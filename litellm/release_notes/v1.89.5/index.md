:::info[Update: no performance regression found]

An earlier version of this note flagged a potential throughput regression. We investigated and could not confirm or reproduce any regression in the released version. The one report we received came from a deployment running custom code on top of what we shipped, and our testing points to those changes, not LiteLLM, as the likely cause.

Correctness and error rates were never affected. If you're on this version, there's nothing you need to do.

We're still monitoring incoming reports and will update this note if anything changes.

`v1.89.5` is a patch release on top of [`v1.89.4`](/release_notes/v1.89.4/v1-89-4). It switches Vertex AI batch-file uploads to a single media upload so large uploads no longer fail with 499 errors, and redacts the API key from `/key/info` client error messages.

### What's Changed

- fix(vertex_ai/files): single media upload for batch files to fix 499s on large uploads - [PR #31653](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/31653)
- fix(proxy/client): redact api key from key/info client error messages - [PR #31342](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/31342)
