`v1.90.6` is a patch release on top of [`v1.90.5`](/release_notes/v1.90.5/v1-90-5). Where `v1.90.5` restored the `litellm-proxy-extras` source folder to the runtime images, this release makes those migration assets usable from any account: the prisma CLI and its engines are now baked at `/opt/prisma`, a fixed path every runtime uid can read. Deployments that run as a non-root user, such as kubernetes `runAsUser` and `docker --user`, previously had prisma fall back to downloading its engines into a home directory it could not write, so a fresh-database migration failed on hosts with no outbound network access. Migrations now run offline under any uid. The release also carries routine dependency maintenance updates to mcp, pypdf, pydantic-settings, python-multipart, and starlette in the image lockfile.

### What's Changed

- fix(docker): bake prisma CLI and engines at a fixed path so fresh-DB migrations work for any uid offline - [PR #33853](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/33853)
