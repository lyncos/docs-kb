`v1.94.2` is a patch release on top of [`v1.94.1`](/release_notes/v1.94.1/v1-94-1). It routes the Admin UI's MCP session-token store through the shared browser storage helper, refreshes the Terraform provider's Go modules, and picks up maintenance updates for four third-party Python dependencies.

In the Admin UI, the MCP session-token store now reads and writes through the same shared storage helper the rest of the dashboard uses, rather than talking to `sessionStorage` directly. The store no longer keeps a refresh token alongside the access token, and its stored payload is no longer written as readable text. This is internal to the browser session and needs no configuration change; the dashboard bundle shipped in this release is rebuilt to include it.

The Terraform provider's `grpc` and `golang.org/x` modules move to current releases. This affects only builds of the provider itself and does not change the proxy image or the Python package.

On the dependency side, `aiohttp` moves to 3.14.3, `cryptography` to 50.0.0, `gitpython` to 3.1.58, and `h2` to 4.4.1, each the smallest step that keeps the release current. The `cryptography` update also widens the `proxy` extra's supported range to `>=49.0.0,<51.0`, matching the range used on the development branch. If you pin `cryptography` below 49 alongside `litellm[proxy]`, adjust that pin when you upgrade.

### What's Changed
