`v1.94.1` is a patch release on top of [`v1.94.0`](/release_notes/v1.94.0/v1-94-0). It reverts the change that made a user's personal `max_budget` apply to their team keys.

If you are on `v1.94.0`, upgrading to `v1.94.1` is recommended. Under `v1.94.0`, once a user's personal spend crossed their own `max_budget`, every request made with a team-scoped key belonging to that user was refused with `429 ExceededBudget`, even when the team had budget left. That check runs on management routes as well as LLM routes, and the Admin UI session token is itself team-scoped, so an affected user was also locked out of the dashboard: key lists, team lists, and most other panels returned `429` and the page rendered empty.

A team-scoped key is once again governed by the team and team-member budgets alone. A user's personal `max_budget` continues to apply to their personal keys, unchanged.

The `general_settings.skip_user_budget_on_team_key` flag that `v1.94.0` introduced as an opt-out is removed in this release. It existed only to switch the reverted behavior off, so it goes away with the behavior rather than remaining as a setting that does nothing. If you set it, remove it from your config; the hierarchy it restored is now the default.
