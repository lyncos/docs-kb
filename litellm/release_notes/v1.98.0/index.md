:::danger[Breaking Changes]

**The Langfuse metadata blob is now sourced from the StandardLoggingPayload allowlist instead of raw request metadata.** Roughly 20 fields no longer appear on the generation, measured live at 52 keys down to 38, so any saved Langfuse filter, dashboard, or alert built on `model_group`, `model_info`, `deployment`, `deployment_model_name`, `model_group_alias`, `model_group_size`, `litellm_api_version`, `litellm_received_at`, `litellm_parent_otel_span`, `queue_time_seconds`, `attempted_retries`, `max_retries`, `agent_id`, `caller_tags`, `inherited_tags`, `global_max_parallel_requests`, `user_api_key`, or the remaining `user_api_key_*` budget and permission-id fields will stop matching. `model_group` and the deployment id are still recoverable from `hidden_params`. Direct-SDK callers passing flat custom metadata must nest it, `metadata={"metadata": {"my_key": "v"}}`, and it arrives under `requester_metadata`; proxy callers are unaffected. `debug_langfuse` now emits caller scalars rather than the raw metadata dump. See [PR #36744](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/36744).

**The Global Control Plane worker registry now requires an Enterprise license.** A proxy configured with `worker_registry` and no valid `LITELLM_LICENSE` refuses to boot instead of silently running unlicensed. Set a valid license to keep the control plane, or remove the `worker_registry` key to start without it. See [PR #36996](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/36996).

**A `litellm_settings.callbacks` entry whose dotted path names a class now fails config load.** Those entries used to be accepted and silently inert: the proxy booted, served traffic, and never ran the hook. Point the entry at an instance or a function, for example `custom_callbacks.proxy_handler_instance`, to start again. See [PR #36858](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/36858).

## Key Highlights

- **Reserved capacity is billed as reserved capacity** - a deployment can now carry `ptu_count` and `cost_per_ptu_per_hour` with an effective window, the daily rollup writes per-model flat cost by active hour, and per-token billing is switched off entirely on that deployment so a team paying for provisioned throughput is no longer charged twice for the same traffic. Attribution is opt-in behind an env var, and a price sent alongside PTU config is rejected with a 400
- **You can measure the auto-router before you adopt it** - a shadow eval job samples a slice of one key's successful traffic, replays it through the auto-router in a detached task that never serves a response or adds latency, and has an LLM judge compare both answers blind with randomized A/B labels. Counts, status, judge spend, and win rates by tier and incumbent model are all derived at read time from one append-only row per sample, and the job also runs in reverse
- **Routing groups are callable models** - `model=<group_name>` now routes across the union of member deployments using the group's own strategy, group names appear in `/v1/models` so Claude Code and Codex discovery surface them, and they are grantable on keys and teams. The Create Group modal has promised this since day one
- **Every response can state its own cost breakdown** - six `x-litellm-response-cost-*` headers ship next to the total, where input, cache read, cache creation, output, and tool usage sum exactly to the total and reasoning is a subset of output, so a platform team attributes spend per component with no local pricing table
- **TPM reservations follow declared output size** - expected output tokens are now declarable per key, per team, and per model instead of one static floor for every tenant, so concurrent requests stop overrunning a team's TPM limit and teams whose models emit far less stop being throttled. No config means byte-identical behavior and no migration
- **The Admin UI's move off antd and Tremor took its largest step yet** - 75 UI pull requests in this window carry the navbar, playground, guardrails, usage, cost tracking, models and endpoints, team and user surfaces, the log details drawer, the AI Hub, and much of the shared component library onto shadcn (base-vega) primitives. The migration is not finished; both libraries remain dependencies and still back parts of the dashboard

Beyond the new entries, this release is a large cost-map maintenance pass: 270 existing entries gain or correct a provider-announced `deprecation_date` across Bedrock, Mistral, Cohere, Gemini, OpenAI, and xAI, and 85 gain a `search_context_cost_per_query` block. xAI pricing is corrected in both directions: the `grok-4.20` reasoning and non-reasoning variants drop from $2.00 / $6.00 to $1.25 / $2.50 per 1M and their context window is corrected from 2M to 1M, while `grok-code-fast` rises from $0.20 / $1.50 to $1.00 / $2.00. The Bedrock Mantle `openai.gpt-5.6-sol`, `-terra`, and `-luna` entries move from a 272K to a 1M context window with matching above-272K tiers, `gpt-5-pro` max output rises from 128K to 272K, the DeepSeek V4 entries go from 8K to 393K max output, and the Groq `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, and `gpt-oss` entries are resynced with Groq's own docs. Native structured output is flagged on 17 entries, `supports_tool_search` on 43, and reasoning-effort flags on a further 29. No pricing entries were removed.

## End-to-End Testing

We are investing heavily in end-to-end testing to cut regressions and make LiteLLM more stable release over release. Every version is exercised by a live suite that runs against a real deployed proxy and hits real provider endpoints, not mocks, so the behavior we validate is the behavior you get in production.

This window added 18 test-only pull requests, 10 of them touching the live e2e suite. Vendor API coverage was hardened so that provider denials, disconnects, server errors, and missing credentials hard-fail instead of passing, and new cells cover Google-native `generateContent` framing, Prometheus queue time, the Anthropic `web_search` server tool on Bedrock, and the model allow-list's positive case rather than only its denials. Admin UI e2e tests no longer stop at a success toast: every mutating flow now asserts the outgoing request body and reads the resource back from the API, with new coverage for Logs, Playground, Usage, and MCP edit and delete. Three reproducers for open gateway gaps in passthrough headers and per-model budgets are checked in skipped, with the product gap named in each skip reason, so removing the skip becomes the regression test once a fix lands. On the maintenance side, OTel assertions now target the attempt that served the stream rather than the span count, live Bedrock tests were repointed off the retired Claude 3 Sonnet, and the stale antd selectors that were failing the UI suite on every run were repointed at what the migrated dashboard actually renders.
