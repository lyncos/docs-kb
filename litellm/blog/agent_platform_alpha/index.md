We're introducing the **LiteLLM Managed Agents Platform** - a simple, self-hosted infrastructure platform for running multiple agents in production.

The main benefit of using this is that it will manage:
- Different sandboxes for different teams/contexts
- Session management across pod restarts/upgrades

We built this because we wanted a managed agent solution, but fully self-hosted. We are excited to have it open sourced and available for everyone to use.
