On April 15, 2026, [OX Security](https://www.ox.security/blog/mcp-supply-chain-advisory-rce-vulnerabilities-across-the-ai-ecosystem/) published an advisory covering **command-injection in Anthropic's MCP SDK's stdio transport** (`StdioServerParameters` runs whatever `command` it's handed). This has been fixed on LiteLLM since `v1.83.6-nightly`.

The fix landed in [commit `7b7f304`](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/commit/7b7f304675) (PR [#25343](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/25343)) and has been in every release from `v1.83.6-nightly` onward. `v1.83.7-stable` includes it.

## TLDR;

- **This was not exploitable by unauthenticated users.** The affected endpoints (MCP server creation and the `/mcp-rest/test/*` preview endpoints) all sit behind LiteLLM's auth. An attacker needed a valid LiteLLM API key, and with the patch the `PROXY_ADMIN` role, before they could reach this code path.
- **The fix has been live since `v1.83.6-nightly`.** The first stable release with the fix is **`v1.83.7-stable`**. Full list of patched versions [below](/blog/mcp-stdio-command-injection-april-2026#versions-with-the-fix).
- **If you find other vulnerabilities, please send them our way.** We run a [bug bounty program](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/security) and pay out for P0 (supply chain) and P1 (unauthenticated proxy access) issues. See our [previous security update](https://docs.litellm.ai/blog/security-hardening-april-2026#bug-bounty-program) for the current bounty table.

## What was the issue

Per OX Security's advisory:

> LiteLLM contains an authenticated remote command execution vulnerability in its MCP server creation functionality. The application allows users to add MCP servers via a JSON configuration specifying arbitrary command and args values. LiteLLM executes these values on the host without validation, enabling attackers to run arbitrary operating system commands.

Concretely: when adding an MCP server with `transport: stdio`, the `command` field was passed straight through to `StdioServerParameters` and executed as a subprocess on the proxy host. An authenticated user with permission to create MCP servers could run arbitrary commands as the LiteLLM process.

- **CVE:** [CVE-2026-30623](https://www.ox.security/blog/mcp-supply-chain-advisory-rce-vulnerabilities-across-the-ai-ecosystem/)
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Auth required:** Yes (authenticated RCE, not unauthenticated)
- **Affected surfaces:**
  - MCP server creation/update (`NewMCPServerRequest`, `UpdateMCPServerRequest`)
  - `/mcp-rest/test/connection` and `/mcp-rest/test/tools/list` preview endpoints
  - Servers rehydrated from config or the DB at runtime

## What the fix does

Commit [`7b7f304`](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/commit/7b7f304675) lands four changes:

1. **Command allowlist for stdio transport.** A new constant `MCP_STDIO_ALLOWED_COMMANDS` restricts stdio `command` values to a small set of known MCP launchers:

    ```python
    MCP_STDIO_ALLOWED_COMMANDS = frozenset(
        {"npx", "uvx", "python", "python3", "node", "docker", "deno"}
    )
    ```

    The list is extensible at deploy time via the `LITELLM_MCP_STDIO_EXTRA_COMMANDS` env var (comma-separated) if you need to allow additional binaries.

2. **Pydantic-level validation.** Both `NewMCPServerRequest` and `UpdateMCPServerRequest` now reject configs whose `command` basename is not in the allowlist, so the bad input never makes it past request parsing.

3. **Defense-in-depth at runtime.** `_create_mcp_client` re-validates the command when instantiating the stdio client, so any `MCPServer` reconstructed from an older DB row or config file (predating the allowlist) is also blocked at spawn time.

4. **Locked down the preview endpoints.** `/mcp-rest/test/connection` and `/mcp-rest/test/tools/list` now require the `PROXY_ADMIN` role. These "try before you add" endpoints were the easiest way to trigger command execution without persisting anything.

## Versions with the fix

The patch is present in every LiteLLM release tagged from `v1.83.6-nightly` onward. Confirmed tags at the time of publishing:

| Version | Type |
|---------|------|
| `v1.83.6-nightly` | First release with the fix |
| `v1.83.7.rc.1` | Release candidate |
| `v1.83.7-stable` | Stable |
| `v1.83.8-nightly` | Nightly |
| `v1.83.9-nightly` | Nightly |
| `v1.83.10-nightly` | Nightly |

Any LiteLLM release newer than these also includes the fix.

## What you should do

- **Upgrade.** Move to `v1.83.7-stable` or later. If you track nightlies, anything `>= v1.83.6-nightly` is patched.
- **Audit existing MCP servers.** If you have stdio MCP servers configured from before the upgrade, any row whose `command` basename isn't in the allowlist will now fail to start. Either update the config to use an allowed launcher (e.g. `npx`, `uvx`, `python`) or add the binary to `LITELLM_MCP_STDIO_EXTRA_COMMANDS`.
- **Review who has `PROXY_ADMIN`.** The stdio test endpoints are now admin-only. If you'd previously delegated MCP testing to non-admin users, they'll now hit a 403.
