![LiteLLM x Akto Partnership](/img/litellm_akto_announcement.png)

[Akto](https://akto.io) now runs natively inside the LiteLLM proxy as a chained guardrail.

{/* truncate */}

LiteLLM already ships with built-in guardrails for fast, deterministic checks (regex-based PII, secret scanning, banned-word lists). Akto adds a second layer on top: **model-based detection** for the cases deterministic rules can't cover, such as prompt injection, semantic PII leaks, and custom policy violations that require an LLM to classify intent.

You run them together. LiteLLM's guardrails handle the cheap, fast checks; Akto handles the scenarios that need a model in the loop.

![Guardrail Chaining: Client → LiteLLM Proxy → LLMs / MCPs / Agents, with LiteLLM Guardrails chaining to Akto](/img/litellm_guardrail_chaining.png)

Akto runs in **sync mode** (block on violation before the LLM is called) or **async mode** (log and alert without adding latency). Configure it as a callback on your existing proxy; no app-level changes.
