Over the last two weeks we addressed two major product quality issues:

1. The MCP Gateway did not have a single class for credential resolution.
2. Pass-through APIs had high memory consumption.

Across the same window we shipped 134 bug fixes in total. This post covers the two big changes first, then the rest of the AI Eng and reliability work, the full breakdown, and what we are doing next.

## MCP Gateway: a single credential resolver

The MCP Gateway connects a user's AI app (Claude Desktop, Cursor, an agent) to the upstream MCP servers it wants to use, and it has to attach the right credential for each upstream.

Before, the MCP Gateway would infer the authentication method a user was trying to use based on the credentials they set. We have now built a credential resolver class that lets a user explicitly specify which auth method they are using. We believe this will significantly drive down a class of bugs users were reporting on MCPs.

### Before: infer the auth method from whatever credentials are set

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Req["Outbound MCP call"] --> Chk{"Which fields are set?<br/>auth_value? client_id?<br/>token? header?"}
  Chk -->|precedence cascade| Pick["Pick one by priority order"]
  Chk -.->|nothing matched| Fall["Silent fallback:<br/>forward caller's token<br/>or attach none"]
  Pick --> Bugs["wrong header forwarded<br/>token sent to wrong upstream<br/>stale or cross-user token"]
  Fall --> Bugs
  classDef bad fill:#fdecec,stroke:#dc2626,color:#7f1d1d;
  class Fall,Bugs bad;
```

Why this was bad: there was no single place that decided which credential to attach, and no error when the decision was ambiguous. Inferring from set fields meant two code paths could read the same server and disagree. The precedence order meant adding a field could silently change which credential won. And the silent fallback meant an unhandled case still sent something upstream instead of refusing. Ambiguity resolved to "attach a credential anyway" instead of "stop."

The types of bugs we saw from this:

- Tokens sent to the wrong upstream server.
- Duplicate or stale `Authorization` headers slipping through.
- MCP requests skipping the normal team, route, and key checks.
- Cached OAuth tokens going stale or crossing between users.
- Upstream URLs and secrets showing up in logs.

### After: the user declares the auth method, and it fails closed

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Req["Outbound MCP call"] --> R{"resolve_credentials<br/>match on the declared mode"}
  R --> m1["none"]
  R --> m2["api_key (static header, BYOK)"]
  R --> m3["passthrough (client forwards token)"]
  R --> m4["authorization_code (per-user OAuth)"]
  R --> m5["client_credentials (gateway M2M)"]
  R --> m6["token_exchange (on-behalf-of)"]
  R --> m7["aws_sigv4 (Bedrock AgentCore)"]
  R ==>|unknown mode| X["Fail closed<br/>type error at build,<br/>raises at runtime, never a silent None"]
  m1 & m2 & m3 & m4 & m5 & m6 & m7 --> Auth["typed auth, one upstream"]
  classDef good fill:#e8f7ee,stroke:#16a34a,color:#14532d;
  classDef bad fill:#fdecec,stroke:#dc2626,color:#7f1d1d;
  class R,Auth good;
  class X bad;
```

Each mode has its own fully typed config, so there is no guessing from which fields are set and no precedence order. The match is exhaustive, so adding a mode without handling it fails the type checker, and an unhandled case raises instead of quietly attaching no auth.

## AI Eng: LLM providers (27 fixes)

AI Eng was focused on driving down reported bugs. Most of them were on new models (Claude 4.8, Opus 4.8, Bedrock Invoke). Here are the types of bugs we fixed:

| Type of bug | Count |
|---|---|
| New model capabilities getting dropped | 10 |
| Wrong cost or billing | 6 |
| Routing or fallback picking the wrong model | 6 |
| Broken response or streaming output | 5 |
| Total | 27 |

Most of these were on Bedrock and the routing layer.

## Performance: pass-through memory

Pass-through APIs had high memory consumption. Large non-JSON pass-through downloads (batch-result files, binary and octet-stream downloads) were buffered whole in memory before being sent on. We changed this to stream the response chunk by chunk, so memory stays flat regardless of file size ([#32386](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/32386)). This covers the provider pass-through routes (`/vertex_ai/*`, `/bedrock/*`, `/openai/*`, `/anthropic/*`, and others) and custom pass-through endpoints.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph B["Before: buffer the whole file"]
    direction LR
    U1[Upstream] -->|entire body| L1["LiteLLM<br/>holds full file in RAM<br/>(memory grows with size)"]
  end
  subgraph A["After: stream it through"]
    direction LR
    U2[Upstream] -->|chunk| L2["LiteLLM<br/>forwards chunk by chunk<br/>(flat memory)"] -->|chunk| C2[Client]
  end
  L1 ~~~ U2
  classDef bad fill:#fdecec,stroke:#dc2626,color:#7f1d1d;
  classDef good fill:#e8f7ee,stroke:#16a34a,color:#14532d;
  class L1 bad;
  class L2 good;
```

JSON responses still buffer by design, so spend logging and guardrails can inspect the body.

Two more fixes in the same spirit, don't pay for work nobody needs:

- Prometheus skips budget-metric DB lookups entirely when the gauges are no-ops (nothing is scraping them).
- The complexity router builds its semantic route index once under concurrent cold-start, instead of rebuilding it per request.

## By the numbers

All 134 fixes, by area:

| Area | Fixes |
|---|---|
| MCP Gateway | 50 |
| LLM Providers (AI Eng) | 27 |
| Proxy Core / Reliability | 23 |
| UI / Dashboard | 20 |
| Logging / Observability | 9 |
| Guardrails | 5 |
| Total | 134 |

These 134 are every merged `fix:` PR in the two weeks. One reported ticket often turns into several fix PRs, so this count is higher than the number of tickets in Linear.

## Next goal: 95% end-to-end test coverage

Most of these 134 bugs were caught late, in staging or from a user report. We want to catch them before they merge. We believe by investing in improving our e2e testing coverage we can significantly reduce the number of reported regressions from users on an upgrade.

We are learning from [Meta's approach to fixing bugs fast](https://engineering.fb.com/2021/02/17/developer-tools/fix-fast/) and raising our testing bar.
