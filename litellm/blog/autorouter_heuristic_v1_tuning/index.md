![Tune AutoRouter Heuristic v1 dimensions to improve routing accuracy for your traffic](./hero.png)

Heuristic v1 scores seven prompt signals, including reasoning language, code, technical terms, and prompt length. You can tune those signals for the traffic your router serves.

:::

We tested that idea on a balanced 240-prompt mix:

| Configuration | Accuracy |
| --- | ---: |
| Default Heuristic v1 | 90.8% |
| Workload-tuned Heuristic v1 | **95.2%** |
| All Opus | 94.9% |

- The tuned configuration cut the classification error rate from **9.2% to 4.8%**, a **48% reduction**.
- It slightly exceeded the all-Opus reference on this benchmark.
- The model ladder and test set stayed fixed, so tuning the heuristic dimensions drove the change.

A useful profile depends on your traffic. Code-heavy workloads and support questions reward different routing choices.

## Tune the signals your workload uses

You can tune:

- `reasoningMarkers`, `multiStepPatterns`, and `questionComplexity` for reasoning-heavy prompts.
- `codePresence` and `technicalTerms` for code and domain-specific traffic.
- `tokenCount` and `simpleIndicators` for prompt length and low-complexity cues.
- A custom dimension for workload-specific vocabulary or structure.

For a useful comparison:

- Start with a held-out sample from your traffic.
- Keep the model ladder and test set fixed.
- Change one signal family at a time and inspect which prompts move tiers.
- Compare accuracy, latency, and tier distribution.

The [shadow evaluation workflow](/docs/auto_router/evaluate) tests a candidate on sampled production traffic without changing the response your user receives.

## Auto-configure from models you already have

Select **Configure automatically**. LiteLLM checks the models your proxy can access and, using current family presets, picks the best available model for each routing tier.

- Each tier uses a model from your existing deployments.
- The configuration opens for review before you save it.
- Anthropic Family uses **Claude Fable 5.1 at high effort** for reasoning traffic.
- OpenAI Family uses **GPT-6 Astra at xhigh effort** for reasoning traffic.

Deployment names do not need to match the catalog. AutoRouter identifies the provider model behind each deployment.

## See LLM classifier activity per 1,000 turns

You can now separate LLM classifier activity from routed requests:

- Normalize classifier activity per 1,000 routed turns.
- Use sessions, turns, and tier distribution to compare routing changes.
- See how often an LLM classifier runs alongside the traffic it routes.

## More controls for agent traffic

Recent AutoRouter changes also cover long-running agent sessions:

- **A `NON_REASONING` tier below Simple** handles tool-result relays, acknowledgements, and reformatting work.
- **Output limits from the selected tier** replace a caller's cap with the chosen model's output ceiling. An explicit per-tier cap still wins.
- **Classifier timeout protection** opens a circuit breaker after a timeout and uses the configured fallback during the cooldown.
- **Cross-provider tool history** lets the Messages API replay `tool_use` history when a session moves between OpenAI and Anthropic tiers.

## Try the AutoRouter

:::info

Open **Add Model → Auto Router** and select **Configure automatically**. Review the generated tiers, then test them against your traffic.

      reasoning_effort: high

  - model_name: smart-router
