title: Prompt Caching Works with Auto Router
description: The most common objection to auto-routing is that switching models throws away your prompt cache. We measured it across five datasets, including real gateway traffic with the provider's own cache accounting, and the answer is no.

![Auto-Router x Prompt Caching: measured across five datasets](./hero.png)

**Yes, you can use prompt caching with Auto-Routing.** The two compound rather than cancel out. We measured it across five datasets, two of which report what the provider's cache actually did.

## The results

- **Auto-routing does not break prompt caching.** The two compound on every dataset we measured
- **37% to 69% cheaper** than caching alone on a single model
- **The real failure mode is the opposite one.** Running a router with caching switched off is about **4x more expensive** than caching one fixed model

| Evaluation | Sample | Router + caching, vs caching alone |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Simulation, general chat ([WildChat-1M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/WildChat-1M)) | 30,769 multi-turn conversations | **68.7% cheaper** |
| Simulation, developer chat ([DevGPT](https://github.com/NAIST-SE/DevGPT)) | 1,011 conversations | **46% cheaper** |
| Real agent traces, provider cache accounting | 95 sessions, 8,174 API calls | **37.4% cheaper** |
| [TwinRouterBench](https://github.com/CommonstackAI/TwinRouterBench) static track | 81 multi-step instances | **44 to 50% cheaper** |

## How it was measured

- **Router arm:** one model group, four tiers. SIMPLE to `claude-haiku-4-5`, MEDIUM to `claude-sonnet-5`, COMPLEX and REASONING to `claude-opus-5`
- **Baseline arm:** every request to one frontier model with prompt caching on, the strongest realistic baseline rather than a cold-priced strawman
- **Cache behaviour:** read from `usage.cache_read_input_tokens` and `cache_creation_input_tokens` on the gateway spend logs and agent traces; modelled on the other three legs
- **Turn classification:** one window function partitioned by session and model, labelling each turn as staying on a model, first visiting a tier, or returning to one already used

## Why auto-routing doesn't break prompt caching

**99.3% of the time a session switches back to a model it used earlier, that model's cache is still warm.** The router comes back long before the cache expires, so a switch is not an eviction.

We measured this on **4,684 real switch-backs** from live LiteLLM gateway traffic.

| Provider cache state | % of Model Returns with Warm Cache |
| --- | --- |
| Still warm at 5m TTL | **97.4%** |
| Still warm at 1h TTL | **99.3%** |
| Past TTL, the only ones a switch could have hurt | **2.6% / 0.7%** |

## We tried a background cache warmer. It wasn't worth it

If switching really did strand the cache, a background refresher that replays a session's prefix would be the fix. We built the measurement for it first.

**Only 4% of cache misses are preventable by a background cache warmer.** The rest either happened while the cache was still alive, or after the model had been idle so long that keeping it warm costs more than the write it avoids.

| Traffic | Typical prefix | What warming does to total cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General chat | ~1,700 tokens | **0.10% more expensive** |
| Agent traces, multi-hour gaps | large | **0.63% more expensive** |
| Our gateway, agentic | ~190,000 tokens | **0.9% cheaper** |

Warming is worth roughly plus or minus two percent: a narrow optimization for long sessions with large stable prefixes, not the thing standing between a deployment and its savings.

## See it on your own traffic

The Auto-Router Benchmarks tab now reports prompt cache behaviour per router, from the provider's own usage payload:

- **Hit rate**, split by whether the turn stayed on a model, first visited a tier, or returned to one
- **Expired-miss share**, narrowing return misses to those whose tier went idle past the TTL
- **Savable by warming**, the share of all misses a refresher could prevent
- **Warming cost and net estimate**, in dollars
- **Coverage**, so a low hit rate caused by response logging being off does not read as a cold cache

Every response carries `x-litellm-model-name` and `x-litellm-response-cost`, and the provider's cache token counts land in the spend logs. Full reference on the [Auto Routing docs page](/docs/proxy/auto_routing).
