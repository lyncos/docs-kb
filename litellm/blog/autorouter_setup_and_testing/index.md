![LiteLLM Autorouter V2: always use the latest models](./hero.png)

We've made it easier than ever to setup and test your Auto-Router, and with customizable tier names + classifier system prompts you can go beyond complexity routing.

## Add an Auto Router (Models + Endpoints → Auto Router)

![The Add Auto Router dialog in Models + Endpoints, with Configure automatically and template options](./auto-setup.png)

- In the LiteLLM Dashboard, go to **Models + Endpoints** and open the **Auto Router** tab. Add a new Auto Router model, or enable and configure an existing one.
- Enter an Auto Router name, then select **Configure automatically** or choose a template. Review the generated tiers, test routing, and save.
- **Configure automatically** checks the models your proxy already serves, selects the best available models for all four tiers, and fills in the form for you
- Picking a family builds the whole config for you with the **latest models** in that family, so every tier is on current models without writing any YAML
- The detail collapses behind a one-line tier summary; presets that reference a model your proxy doesn't serve grey out and tell you which one is missing
- More families are coming; today Anthropic and OpenAI are covered, and Custom is there for everything else

## Let your agent set up the router

Paste this into Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or any agent with shell access:

```
run curl -fsSL https://docs.litellm.ai/skills/auto-router and follow the instructions
```

- It reads the models your proxy already serves, then interviews you for the router name and the model behind each tier
- It writes the config for you, whether your proxy is file-based or DB-managed
- Before finishing it lists the defaults it left in place, with what changing each one buys, and asks whether you want any changed

## Test Routing in the UI during setup

- **Test Routing** now sits beside Test Connection on the Add Auto Router form
- Send a prompt, see the tier it lands in and why, against the config currently on screen
- Nothing is created and nothing is sent to the routed model, so it costs nothing beyond your LLM classifier (if enabled)

## Replace the classifier's system prompt

The LLM classifier shipped with one built-in rubric, so the router could only grade complexity. `classifier_llm_config.system_prompt` now allows you to define your own routing criteria, whether you want a more in-depth prompt for complexity or routing based on another criterion such as data sensitivity or model capability (vision, audio, image).

- `classifier_fallback` decides what happens when classification fails: the heuristic scorer, or straight to `default_model`

## Customize your tiers

Along with the above change, you can now change the tier names from the default: SIMPLE / MEDIUM / COMPLEX / REASONING. If your team prefers Fast / Standard / Premium / Deep or Image / Video / Audio / Text, an optional `tier_labels` map renames them.

- Names change in the dashboard, the spend logs, and the LLM classifier's rubric, so the classifier reasons in your vocabulary
- Display-only. Config keys stay canonical, routing behavior doesn't move, and API callers never see these names
- Partial maps are fine; unlisted tiers keep the default name

## Configurable reminder markers, easy OpenClaw integration

The router strips harness-injected context before classifying, so a token-budget note doesn't get graded as the user's actual question. That marker pair was hardcoded to `<system-reminder>`; a new `reminder_markers` field lets harnesses like OpenClaw use their own markers.

```yaml
complexity_router_config:
  reminder_markers:
    - "<<<begin_ctx>>>"
    - "<<<end_ctx>>>"
```
