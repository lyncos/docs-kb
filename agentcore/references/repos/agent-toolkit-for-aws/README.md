Help AI coding agents build, deploy, and manage applications on AWS.

The Agent Toolkit for AWS gives AI coding agents the tools, knowledge, and guardrails they need to work with AWS services. It works with the coding agents developers already use — including Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Kiro, and fx.

## Quick start

### AWS CLI

Use the Agent Toolkit directly from your terminal with the AWS CLI:

```
aws configure agent-toolkit
```

See the [AWS CLI integration guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/agent-toolkit/latest/userguide/aws-cli.html) for setup, configuration, and usage instructions.

### Claude Code

The plugins are available on the official Anthropic marketplace (`claude-plugins-official`) which is added to your Claude Code installation by default.
Use the following commands to install supported plugins from the toolkit:

For `aws-core` that covers service selection, CDK/CloudFormation, serverless, containers, storage, observability, billing, SDK usage, and deployment:

```
/plugin install aws-core@claude-plugins-official
```

> **Tip:** If you get `Plugin not found`, update your local marketplace index first:
>
> ```
> /plugin marketplace update claude-plugins-official
> ```

For `aws-agents` that covers building AI agents on AWS with Amazon Bedrock and AgentCore:

```
/plugin install aws-agents@claude-plugins-official
```

For `aws-data-analytics` that covers data lake, analytics, and ETL workflows with S3 Tables, AWS Glue, and Athena:

```
/plugin install aws-data-analytics@claude-plugins-official
```

For `aws-agents-for-devsecops` used to investigate incidents, review code and execute UAT for release readiness, scan code for vulnerabilities, and run penetration tests with AWS DevOps Agent and AWS Security Agent.

```
/plugin marketplace add aws/agent-toolkit-for-aws
/plugin install aws-agents-for-devsecops
/reload-plugins

# Or from Claude's official marketplace:
/plugin install aws-agents-for-devsecops@claude-plugins-official
/reload-plugins

# Setup:
/aws-agents-for-devsecops:setup
```

For `aws-startup-advisor` that covers startup-focused architecture, cost, security, and AWS Activate guidance, plus migrations to AWS from Azure, GCP, Heroku, and AI stacks such as OpenAI and Gemini, install from this repository's marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add aws/agent-toolkit-for-aws
/plugin install aws-startup-advisor@agent-toolkit-for-aws
/reload-plugins
```

### Codex

In your terminal:

```
codex plugin marketplace add aws/agent-toolkit-for-aws
```

Then launch Codex and run `/plugins` to browse and install the **aws-core** plugin.

### Cursor

Add this repository as a team marketplace from **Settings → Plugins → Team Marketplaces → Add Marketplace → Import from Repo**, pointing it at `aws/agent-toolkit-for-aws`. Cursor indexes the plugins listed in [`.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json`](.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json) on import.

Then open the **Plugins** panel and install the **aws-core** plugin (start here), or **aws-agents** and **aws-data-analytics** as needed. Each plugin bundles the AWS MCP Server configuration and agent skills.

### Kiro

Kiro setup has two independent parts: the AWS MCP Server (for runtime AWS API access and documentation search) and local skills (for task-specific agent guidance). They complement each other but work independently — skills don't require the MCP server, and the MCP server doesn't serve locally-installed skills.

**1. Add the AWS MCP Server** to your Kiro MCP configuration (`.kiro/settings/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aws": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-proxy-for-aws-cli@latest",
        "https://aws-mcp.us-east-1.api.aws/mcp",
        "--metadata",
        "AWS_REGION=us-west-2"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP server gives your agent access to AWS APIs, sandboxed script execution, and real-time documentation search.

**2. Install skills** from this repository:

```
npx skills add aws/agent-toolkit-for-aws/skills
```

This installs skill files to `~/.kiro/skills/` (global) or `.kiro/skills/` (project-level). Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file and optionally a `references/` subdirectory with additional context the agent reads from the local filesystem when needed. Kiro discovers installed skills automatically and activates them on demand when a task matches.

> **Prerequisites:** You need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed. An AWS account with credentials configured locally is required for API calls and script execution, but not for documentation search or skill discovery. See the [user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/agent-toolkit/latest/userguide/) for detailed setup instructions.

### fx

[fx](https://fx.sh) setup has the same two independent parts as Kiro: the AWS MCP Server (for runtime AWS API access and documentation search) and local skills (for task-specific agent guidance). Skills don't require the MCP server, and the MCP server doesn't serve locally-installed skills.

**1. Add the AWS MCP Server** from your terminal. fx stores MCP servers in `~/.fx/mcp.json`, so the server is available in every project:

```
fx mcp add aws uvx mcp-proxy-for-aws-cli@latest https://aws-mcp.us-east-1.api.aws/mcp --metadata AWS_REGION=us-west-2
```

Or add it to `~/.fx/mcp.json` by hand. fx uses the `mcp` key rather than `mcpServers`, `type` to select the transport, and a single `command` array holding the executable and its arguments:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "aws": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": [
        "uvx",
        "mcp-proxy-for-aws-cli@latest",
        "https://aws-mcp.us-east-1.api.aws/mcp",
        "--metadata",
        "AWS_REGION=us-west-2"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If a session is already open when you edit the file, run `/mcp reload` to pick up the change. The MCP server gives your agent access to AWS APIs, sandboxed script execution, and real-time documentation search.

**2. Install skills** from this repository:

```
npx skills add aws/agent-toolkit-for-aws/skills -a fx
```

This installs skill files to `.fx/skills/` (project-level); add `-g` to install to `~/.fx/skills/` (global). fx also discovers skills already installed for other agents in `.agents/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, and `.codex/skills/`, so a project set up for Codex or Claude Code needs no second copy. Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file and optionally a `references/` subdirectory with additional context the agent reads from the local filesystem when needed. fx reads skill metadata at startup and loads a skill's instructions when you or the agent invokes it; type `$` in the composer or run `/skills` to browse what's installed.

> **Prerequisites:** You need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed. An AWS account with credentials configured locally is required for API calls and script execution, but not for documentation search or skill discovery. See the [user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/agent-toolkit/latest/userguide/) for detailed setup instructions.

### Other agents

See the [AWS MCP Server getting started guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/agent-toolkit/latest/userguide/getting-started-aws-mcp-server.html) for instructions on configuring the AWS MCP Server with your agent.

Then install skills from this repository:

```
npx skills add aws/agent-toolkit-for-aws/skills
```

Plugins are currently available for Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor. For other agents, configure the AWS MCP Server directly and install skills from this repository.

### Skills

Agent skills are curated packages of instructions and reference materials that help agents complete specific AWS tasks. Skills are loaded on demand — agents discover and retrieve only what's relevant to the current task.

```
npx skills add aws/agent-toolkit-for-aws/skills
```

Browse the [`skills/`](skills/) directory to see all available skills.

### Rules files

Recommended project-level configuration files that tell agents how to use AWS most effectively — for example, by using the AWS MCP Server, discovering available skills, or searching documentation before acting.

See [`rules/`](rules/) for details.

### AWS MCP Server

The [AWS MCP Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/agent-toolkit/latest/userguide/understanding-mcp-server-tools.html) is a managed server that gives agents access to AWS through the Model Context Protocol. It provides:

- **Full AWS API coverage** — Interact with any of the 300+ AWS services through a single authenticated endpoint.
- **Sandboxed script execution** — Agents can run Python scripts in an isolated environment for complex multi-step operations.
- **Real-time documentation access** — Search and retrieve current AWS documentation, API references, and service capabilities without authentication.
- **Enterprise controls** — Amazon CloudWatch metrics, IAM context keys for agent-specific policies, and AWS CloudTrail audit logging.

For details on operation, available tools, authentication, and supported Regions, see the [AWS MCP Server documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/agent-toolkit/latest/userguide/understanding-mcp-server-tools.html).

## Documentation

- [User guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/agent-toolkit/latest/userguide/) — Setup, configuration, and reference documentation.
- [AWS MCP Server tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/agent-toolkit/latest/userguide/understanding-mcp-server-tools.html) — Reference for all available MCP tools.

## How the Agent Toolkit relates to the MCP servers, skills, and plugins in AWS Labs

In 2025, AWS began releasing MCP servers, skills, and plugins as part of [AWS Labs](https://github.com/awslabs). The Agent Toolkit for AWS is the successor to those tools. We recommend using the Agent Toolkit for AWS, because it offers key features including:

- IAM condition keys that distinguish between agent actions and human actions, so you can write policies that apply only to agents. For example, you can write policies that only allow read-only actions through the MCP server, even if the user’s underlying IAM role can take write actions).
- CloudWatch metrics and CloudTrail audit logging for every request, so you can monitor and audit coding agent activity.
- Agent skills that have undergone thorough end-to-end evaluations, so you can be confident that workflows will complete successfully.

[AWS Labs](https://github.com/awslabs) MCP servers, skills, and plugins will continue to work and accept contributions, and over time the best of AWS Labs will be transitioned to the Agent Toolkit for AWS to ensure that customers can access the broadest array of tooling and guidance for their agents.
