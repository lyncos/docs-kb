# Sign up for AWS (advanced)
<a name="getting-started"></a>

If you're new to AWS, the first step is to sign up for an AWS account. When you follow the information for Sign up for AWS (advanced), AWS creates an account where you have complete control over account configuration and where your content is stored. Use this option if you have regulated workloads such as HIPAA, FedRAMP.

To compare this sign up with Sign up for AWS (new), see [Compare sign-up options](sign-up-for-aws.md).

To sign up for an AWS account, you'll need to provide the following information:
+ **Root user email address** – The email address is used as the sign-in name for the [root user](root-user.md) and is required for account recovery. You must be able to receive email messages that are sent to this address. Before you can perform certain tasks, you must verify that you have access to email sent to this address.
+ **AWS account name** – The name of the account appears in several places, such as on your invoice, and in consoles such as the Billing and Cost Management dashboard and the AWS Organizations console. We recommend that you use a standard way to name your accounts so that you can give your accounts names that are easy to recognize. For company accounts, consider using a naming standard such as *organization*-*purpose*-*environment* (for example, *AnyCompany*-*audit*-*prod*). For personal accounts, consider using a naming standard such as *first name*-*last name*-*purpose* (for example, *paulo-santos-testaccount*).
+ **Address** – If your contact and billing address is in India, the user agreement for your account is with Amazon Web Services India Private Limited (AWS India), a local AWS seller in India. You must provide your CVV as part of the verification process. You might also have to enter a one-time password, depending on your bank. AWS India charges your payment method 2 INR as part of the verification process. AWS India refunds the 2 INR after verification is complete.
+ **Phone number** – This number is used for identity verification purposes and to confirm the ownership of your account. You must be able to receive calls and SMS messages at this phone number.
**Important**  
If this account is for a business, use a corporate phone number so that your company can retain access to the AWS account even when an employee changes positions or leaves the company.

## Step 1: Create your account
<a name="getting-started-step1"></a>

These instructions are for creating an AWS account outside of India. For creating an account in India, see [Create an AWS account with AWS India](managing-accounts-india.md#create-india-account). For creating an account that's part of an organization managed by AWS Organizations, see [Creating a member account in an organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html) in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*.

------
#### [ AWS Management Console ]

**To create an AWS account**

1. Open the [Sign up for AWS](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signup?request_type=register) page.

1. Enter the root user email address and AWS account name, and then choose **Verify email address**. This sends a verification code to your email address.
**Important**  
If this account is for a business, use a secure corporate distribution list (for example, `it.admins@example.com`) so that your company can retain access to the AWS account even when an employee changes positions or leaves the company. Because the email address can be used to reset the account's root user credentials, protect access to this distribution list or address.

1. Enter your verification code, and then choose **Verify**.

1. Enter a strong password for your root user, confirm it, and then choose **Continue**. AWS requires that your password meet the following conditions:
   + It must have a minimum of 8 characters and a maximum of 128 characters.
   + It must include a minimum of three of the following mix of character types: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and \! @ \# $ % ^ & \* () <> [] {} \| \_\+-= symbols.
   + It must not be identical to your AWS account name or email address.

1. Choose your account plan. For more information, see [Free Tier plans](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/free-tier-plans.html).

1. Enter your contact information, then read and accept the [AWS Customer Agreement](https://aws.amazon.com/agreement/). Make sure you understand the terms before accepting.
**Important**  
If this account is for a business, it's a best practice to enter a company phone number rather than a number for a personal phone. Configuring the account's root user with an individual email address or a personal phone number can make your account insecure.

1. Enter your billing information. If you want to use a different billing address for your AWS billing information, choose **Use a new address**.

   You can't proceed with the sign-up process until you add a valid payment method.

1. You might need to confirm your identity:

   1. For **Country or region code**, enter a phone number that can be reached in the next few minutes.

   1. For **Phone number**, enter a phone number that can be reached in the next few minutes.

   1. Choose **Send SMS**.

   1. When the automated system contacts you, enter the code you receive and then choose **Continue**.

1. Choose one of the available AWS Support plans. For a description of the available Support plans and their benefits, see [Compare Support plans](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/features).

1. Choose **Complete sign up**. A confirmation page appears that indicates that your account is being activated.

1. Check your email and spam folder for an email message that confirms your account was activated. Activation usually takes a few minutes but can sometimes take up to 24 hours.

1. After you receive the activation message, you can sign-in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) to start using AWS services. For general information about how to manage your account settings, see [Configure your AWS account](managing-accounts.md).

For multiple AWS accounts managed through AWS Organizations, assign administrative access to an administrative user in IAM Identity Center. For instructions, see [Set up AWS account access for an IAM Identity Center administrative user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/get-started-assign-account-access-admin-user.html) in the *IAM Identity Center User Guide*.

------
#### [ AWS CLI & SDKs ]

You can create member accounts in an organization that is managed by AWS Organizations by running the [CreateAccount](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAccount.html) operation while signed in to the organization's management account.

You can't create a standalone AWS account outside of an organization by using an AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or AWS API operation.

## Step 2: (Recommended) Install the AWS CLI
<a name="getting-started-step2"></a>

Install the AWS CLI by following the instructions at [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html). You need version 2.32.0 or later.

You can use the AWS CLI to have an agent manage AWS resources on your behalf.

After you install the AWS CLI, use the following command to sign in programmatically:

```
aws login
```

This automatically rotates your credentials every 15 minutes, keeping your session valid for up to 12 hours without manual intervention.

Use the following command to verify your credentials are working:

```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

For more information about accessing your AWS account, see [Accessing your AWS account](accounts-access-account.md).

## Step 3: (Recommended) Set up the AWS MCP Server
<a name="getting-started-step3"></a>

The AWS MCP Server is a managed server that gives agents access to AWS through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Agents can search AWS documentation and retrieve service information without authentication. To execute AWS API calls, run Python scripts in a sandboxed environment, or follow curated skills, agents authenticate through your existing IAM credentials. For more information, see [What is the AWS Agent Toolkit?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/agent-toolkit/latest/userguide/what-is-agent-toolkit.html)
