# Amazon DynamoDB endpoints and quotas
<a name="ddb"></a>

To connect programmatically to an AWS service, you use an endpoint. AWS services offer the following endpoint types in some or all of the AWS Regions that the service supports: IPv4 endpoints, dual-stack endpoints, and FIPS endpoints. Some services provide global endpoints. For more information, see [AWS service endpoints](rande.md).

Service quotas, also referred to as limits, are the maximum number of service resources or operations for your AWS account. For more information, see [AWS service quotas](aws_service_limits.md).

The following are the service endpoints and service quotas for this service.

For more information about this topic specific to DynamoDB, see [Quotas in Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Limits.html).

### DynamoDB

Newer versions of the AWS SDK connect to Amazon DynamoDB using the AWS-account-based endpoints listed below. For more information, see [Account-based endpoints ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-account-endpoints.html).
