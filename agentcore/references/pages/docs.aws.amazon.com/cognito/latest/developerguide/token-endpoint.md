# The token issuer endpoint
<a name="token-endpoint"></a>

The OAuth 2.0 [token endpoint](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-3.2) at `/oauth2/token` issues JSON web tokens (JWTs) to applications that want to complete authorization-code and client-credentials grant flows. These tokens are the end result of authentication with a user pool. They contain information about the user (ID token), the user's level of access (access token), and the user's entitlement to persist their signed-in session (refresh token). OpenID Connect (OIDC) relying-party libraries handle requests to and response payloads from this endpoint. Tokens provide verifiable proof of authentication, profile information, and a mechanism for access to back-end systems.

The token endpoint returns an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` response header. You can call the token endpoint cross-origin from a browser-based application. For example, you can complete an authorization code grant with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) from a public client. Amazon Cognito does not support custom cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) origin policies on this endpoint. For more information, see the CORS policies section of [User pool managed login](cognito-user-pools-managed-login.md).

Your user pool OAuth 2.0 authorization server issues JSON web tokens (JWTs) from the token endpoint to the following types of sessions:

1. Users who have completed a request for an authorization code grant. Successful redemption of a code returns ID, access, and refresh tokens.

1. Machine-to-machine (M2M) sessions that have completed a client-credentials grant. Successful authorization with the client secret returns an access token.

1. Users who have previously signed in and received refresh tokens. Refresh token authentication returns new ID and access tokens.
**Note**  
Users who sign in with an authorization code grant in managed login or through federation can always refresh their tokens from the token endpoint. Users who sign in with the API operations `InitiateAuth` and `AdminInitiateAuth` can refresh their tokens with the token endpoint when [remembered devices](amazon-cognito-user-pools-device-tracking.md) is *not* active in your user pool. If remembered devices is active, refresh tokens with the [relevant API or SDK token-refresh operation](amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-the-refresh-token.md#using-the-refresh-token-api) for your app client.

The token endpoint becomes publicly available when you add a domain to your user pool. It accepts HTTP POST requests. For application security, use PKCE with your authorization code sign-in events. PKCE verifies that the user passing an authorization code is that same user who authenticated. For more information about PKCE, see [IETF RFC 7636](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636).

You can learn more about the user pool app clients and their grant types, client secrets, allowed scopes, and client IDs at [Application-specific settings with app clients](user-pool-settings-client-apps.md). You can learn more about M2M authorization, client credentials grants, and authorization with access token scopes at [Scopes, M2M, and resource servers](cognito-user-pools-define-resource-servers.md).

To retrieve information about a user from their access token, pass it to your [userInfo endpoint](userinfo-endpoint.md) or to a [GetUser](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_GetUser.html) API request. The access token must contain the appropriate scopes for these requests,

## Format a POST request to the token endpoint
<a name="post-token"></a>

The `/oauth2/token` endpoint only supports `HTTPS POST`. This endpoint is not user-interactive. Handle token requests with an [OpenID Connect (OIDC) library](https://openid.net/developers/certified-openid-connect-implementations/) in your application.

The token endpoint supports `client_secret_basic` and `client_secret_post` authentication. For more information about the OIDC specification, see [Client Authentication](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication). For more information about the token endpoint from the OpenID Connect specification, see [Token Endpoint](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#TokenEndpoint).

### Request parameters in header
<a name="post-token-request-parameters"></a>

You can pass the following parameters in the header of your request to the token endpoint.

**`Authorization`**  
If the client was issued a secret, the client can pass its `client_id` and `client_secret` in the authorization header as `client_secret_basic` HTTP authorization. You can also include the `client_id` and `client_secret` in the request body as `client_secret_post` authorization.  
The authorization header string is [Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication#Client_side) `Base64Encode(client_id:client_secret)`. The following example is an authorization header for app client `djc98u3jiedmi283eu928` with client secret `abcdef01234567890`, using the Base64-encoded version of the string `djc98u3jiedmi283eu928:abcdef01234567890`:  

```
Authorization: Basic ZGpjOTh1M2ppZWRtaTI4M2V1OTI4OmFiY2RlZjAxMjM0NTY3ODkw
```

**`Content-Type`**  
Set the value of this parameter to `'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'`.

### Request parameters in body
<a name="post-token-request-parameters-in-body"></a>

The following are parameters that you can request in `x-www-form-urlencoded` format in the request body to the token endpoint.

**`grant_type`**  
*Required.*  
The type of OIDC grant that you want to request.  
Must be `authorization_code` or `refresh_token` or `client_credentials`. You can request an access token for a custom scope from the token endpoint under the following conditions:  
+ You enabled the requested scope in your app client configuration.
+ You configured your app client with a client secret.
+ You enable client credentials grant in your app client.
The token endpoint returns a refresh token only when the `grant_type` is `authorization_code`.

**`client_id`**  
*Optional. Not required when you provide the app client ID in the `Authorization` header.*  
The ID of an app client in your user pool. Specify the same app client that authenticated your user.  
You must provide this parameter if the client is public and does not have a secret, or with `client_secret` in `client_secret_post` authorization.

**`client_secret`**  
*Optional. Not required when you provide the client secret in the `Authorization` header and when the app client doesn't have a secret.*  
The app client secret, if the app client has one, for `client_secret_post` authorization.

**`scope`**  
*Optional.*  
Can be a combination of any scopes that are associated with your app client. Amazon Cognito ignores scopes in the request that aren't allowed for the requested app client. If you don't provide this request parameter, the authorization server returns an access token `scope` claim with all authorization scopes that you enabled in your app client configuration. You can request any of the scopes allowed for the requested app client: standard scopes, custom scopes from resource servers, and the `aws.cognito.signin.user.admin` user self-service scope.

**`redirect_uri`**  
*Optional. Not required for client-credentials grants.*  
Must be the same `redirect_uri` that was used to get `authorization_code` in `/oauth2/authorize`.  
You must provide this parameter if `grant_type` is `authorization_code`.

**`refresh_token`**  
*Optional. Used only when the user already has a refresh token and wishes to get new ID and access tokens.*  
To generate new access and ID tokens for a user's session, set the value of `refresh_token` to a valid refresh token that the requested app client issued.  
Returns a new refresh token with new ID and access token when [refresh token rotation](amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-the-refresh-token.md#using-the-refresh-token-rotation) is active, otherwise returns only ID and access tokens. If the original access token was [bound to an API resource](cognito-user-pools-define-resource-servers.md#cognito-user-pools-resource-binding), the new access token maintains the requested API url in the `aud` claim.

**`code`**  
*Optional. Only required in authorization-code grants.*  
The authorization code from an authorization code grant. You must provide this parameter if your authorization request included a `grant_type` of `authorization_code`.

**`aws_client_metadata`**  
*Optional.*  
Information that you want to pass to the [Pre token generation Lambda trigger](user-pool-lambda-pre-token-generation.md) in [machine-to-machine (M2M)](cognito-user-pools-define-resource-servers.md) authorization flows. Your application can collect context information about the session and pass it in this parameter. When you pass `aws_client_metadata` in URL-encoded JSON format, Amazon Cognito includes it in the input event to your trigger Lambda function. Your pre token trigger event version or global Lambda trigger version must be configured for version three or later. Although Amazon Cognito accepts requests to this endpoint in authorization code and client credentials M2M flows, your user pool only passes `aws_client_metadata` to the pre token generation trigger from client credentials requests.

**`code_verifier`**  
Optional. Required only if you provided `code_challenge_method` and `code_challenge` parameters in your initial authorization request.  
The generated code verifier that your application calculated the `code_challenge` from in an authorization code grant request with [PKCE](using-pkce-in-authorization-code.md).

## Exchanging an authorization code for tokens
<a name="post-token-positive-exchanging-authorization-code-for-tokens"></a>

The following request successfully generates ID, access, and refresh tokens after authentication with an authorization-code grant. The request passes the client secret in `client_secret_basic` format in the `Authorization` header.

```
POST https://mydomain.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token&
Content-Type='application/x-www-form-urlencoded'&
Authorization=Basic {{ZGpjOTh1M2ppZWRtaTI4M2V1OTI4OmFiY2RlZjAxMjM0NTY3ODkw}}

grant_type=authorization_code&
client_id={{1example23456789}}&
code={{AUTHORIZATION_CODE}}&
redirect_uri={{com.myclientapp://myclient/redirect}}
```

The response issues new ID, access, and refresh tokens to the user, with additional metadata.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "access_token": "{{eyJra1example}}",
    "id_token": "{{eyJra2example}}",
    "refresh_token": "{{eyJj3example}}",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": {{3600}}
}
```

## Client credentials with basic authorization
<a name="exchanging-client-credentials-for-an-access-token-in-request-body"></a>

The following request from an M2M application requests a client credentials grant. Because client credentials requires a client secret, the request is authorized with an `Authorization` header derived from the app client ID and secret. The request results in an access token with the two requested scopes. The request also includes client metadata that provides IP-address information and a token issued to the user who this grant is on behalf of. Amazon Cognito passes the client metadata to the pre token generation Lambda trigger.

```
POST https://mydomain.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token >
Content-Type='application/x-www-form-urlencoded'&
Authorization=Basic {{ZGpjOTh1M2ppZWRtaTI4M2V1OTI4OmFiY2RlZjAxMjM0NTY3ODkw}}

grant_type=client_credentials&
client_id={{1example23456789}}&
scope={{resourceServerIdentifier1}}%2F{{scope1}}%20{{resourceServerIdentifier2}}%2F{{scope2}}&
&aws_client_metadata={{%7B%22onBehalfOfToken%22%3A%22eyJra789ghiEXAMPLE%22,%20%22ClientIpAddress%22%3A%22192.0.2.252%22%7D}}
```

Amazon Cognito passes the following input event to the pre token generation Lambda trigger.

```
{
    version: '3',
    triggerSource: 'TokenGeneration_ClientCredentials',
    region: '{{us-east-1}}',
    userPoolId: '{{us-east-1_EXAMPLE}}',
    userName: 'ClientCredentials',
    callerContext: {
        awsSdkVersion: '{{aws-sdk-unknown-unknown}}',
        clientId: '{{1example23456789}}'
    },
    request: {
        userAttributes: {},
        groupConfiguration: null,
        scopes: [
           'resourceServerIdentifier1/scope1',
           'resourceServerIdentifier2/scope2'
        ],
        clientMetadata: {
            'onBehalfOfToken': 'eyJra789ghiEXAMPLE',
            'ClientIpAddress': '192.0.2.252'
        }
    },
    response: { claimsAndScopeOverrideDetails: null }
}
```

The response returns an access token. Client credentials grants are for machine-to-machine (M2M) authorization and only return access tokens.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "access_token": "{{eyJra1example}}",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": {{3600}}
}
```

## Client credentials with POST body authorization
<a name="post-token-positive-exchanging-client-credentials-for-an-access-token-in-request-body"></a>

The following client-credentials grant request includes the `client_secret` parameter in the request body and doesn't include an `Authorization` header. This request uses the `client_secret_post` authorization syntax. The request results in an access token with the requested scope. The request also includes client metadata that provides IP-address information and a token issued to the user who this grant is on behalf of. Amazon Cognito passes the client metadata to the pre token generation Lambda trigger.

```
POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1

```

Amazon Cognito passes the following input event to the pre token generation Lambda trigger.

```
{
    version: '3',
    triggerSource: 'TokenGeneration_ClientCredentials',
    region: '{{us-east-1}}',
    userPoolId: '{{us-east-1_EXAMPLE}}',
    userName: 'ClientCredentials',
    callerContext: {
        awsSdkVersion: '{{aws-sdk-unknown-unknown}}',
        clientId: '{{1example23456789}}'
    },
    request: {
        userAttributes: {},
        groupConfiguration: null,
        scopes: [
           'resourceServerIdentifier1/my_custom_scope'
        ],
        clientMetadata: {
            'onBehalfOfToken': 'eyJra789ghiEXAMPLE',
            'ClientIpAddress': '192.0.2.252'
        }
    },
    response: { claimsAndScopeOverrideDetails: null }
}
```

The response returns an access token. Client credentials grants are for machine-to-machine (M2M) authorization and only return access tokens.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

## Authorization code grant with PKCE
<a name="post-token-positive-exchanging-authorization-code-grant-with-pkce-for-tokens"></a>

The following example request completes an authorization request that included `code_challenge_method` and `code_challenge` parameters in an authorization code grant request with [PKCE](using-pkce-in-authorization-code.md).

```
POST https://mydomain.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token
Content-Type='application/x-www-form-urlencoded'&
Authorization=Basic {{ZGpjOTh1M2ppZWRtaTI4M2V1OTI4OmFiY2RlZjAxMjM0NTY3ODkw}}

grant_type=authorization_code&
client_id={{1example23456789}}&
code={{AUTHORIZATION_CODE}}&
code_verifier={{CODE_VERIFIER}}&
redirect_uri={{com.myclientapp://myclient/redirect}}
```

The response returns ID, access, and refresh tokens from the successful PKCE verification by the application.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "access_token": "{{eyJra1example}}",
    "id_token": "{{eyJra2example}}",
    "refresh_token": "{{eyJj3example}}",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": {{3600}}
}
```

## Token refresh without refresh token rotation
<a name="post-token-positive-exchanging-a-refresh-token-for-tokens"></a>

The following example requests provides a refresh token to an app client where [refresh token rotation](amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-the-refresh-token.md#using-the-refresh-token-rotation) is inactive. Because the app client has a client secret, the request provides an `Authorization` header.

```
POST https://mydomain.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token >
Content-Type='application/x-www-form-urlencoded'&
Authorization=Basic {{ZGpjOTh1M2ppZWRtaTI4M2V1OTI4OmFiY2RlZjAxMjM0NTY3ODkw}}

grant_type=refresh_token&
client_id={{1example23456789}}&
refresh_token={{eyJj3example}}
```

The response returns new ID and access tokens.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "access_token": "{{eyJra1example}}",
    "id_token": "{{eyJra2example}}",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": {{3600
}}}
```

## Token refresh with refresh token rotation
<a name="post-token-positive-refresh-token-rotation"></a>

The following example requests provides a refresh token to an app client where [refresh token rotation](amazon-cognito-user-pools-using-the-refresh-token.md#using-the-refresh-token-rotation) is active. Because the app client has a client secret, the request provides an `Authorization` header.

```
POST https://mydomain.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token >
Content-Type='application/x-www-form-urlencoded'&
Authorization=Basic {{ZGpjOTh1M2ppZWRtaTI4M2V1OTI4OmFiY2RlZjAxMjM0NTY3ODkw}}

grant_type=refresh_token&
client_id={{1example23456789}}&
refresh_token={{eyJj3example}}
```

The response returns new ID, access, and refresh tokens.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "access_token": "{{eyJra1example}}",
    "id_token": "{{eyJra2example}}",
    "refresh_token": "{{eyJj4example}}",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": {{3600}}
}
```

## Examples of negative responses
<a name="post-token-negative"></a>

Malformed requests generate errors from the token endpoint. The following is a general map of the response body when token requests generate an error.

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

{
"error":"invalid_request|invalid_client|invalid_grant|unauthorized_client|unsupported_grant_type"
}
```

**`invalid_request`**  
The request is missing a required parameter, includes an unsupported parameter value (other than `unsupported_grant_type`), or is otherwise malformed. For example, `grant_type` is `refresh_token` but `refresh_token` is not included. 

**`invalid_client`**  
Client authentication failed. For example, when the client includes `client_id` and `client_secret` in the authorization header, but there's no such client with that `client_id` and `client_secret`. 

**`invalid_grant`**  
Refresh token has been revoked.   
Authorization code has been consumed already or does not exist.   
App client doesn't have read access to all [attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html) in the requested scope. For example, your app requests the `email` scope and your app client can read the `email` attribute, but not `email_verified`.

**`unauthorized_client`**  
Client is not allowed for code grant flow or for refreshing tokens.   
A token request with a `redirect_uri` that does not match the value from the authorization request, returns `unauthorized_client` with an `error_description` of `invalid_redirect`.

**`unsupported_grant_type`**  
Returned if `grant_type` is anything other than `authorization_code` or `refresh_token` or `client_credentials`.
