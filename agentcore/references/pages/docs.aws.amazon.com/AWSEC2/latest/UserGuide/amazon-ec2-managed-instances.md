# Amazon EC2 managed instances
<a name="amazon-ec2-managed-instances"></a>

An *Amazon EC2 managed instance* is an EC2 instance that is provisioned and managed by a designated service provider. Managed instances provide a simplified way for running compute workloads on Amazon EC2 by allowing you to delegate operational control of the instance to a service provider.

Delegated control is the only change introduced for managed instances. The technical specifications and billing remain the same as non-managed EC2 instances. Because managed instances allow you to delegate control to the service provider, you can benefit from the service provider’s operational expertise and best practices. When an instance is managed, the service provider is responsible for tasks such as provisioning the instance, configuring software, scaling capacity, handling instance failures and replacements, and terminating the instance.

You can’t directly modify the settings of a managed instance or terminate it. The service and specific operations are determined by the agreement between you and the service provider. However, you can add, modify, or remove tags from your managed instances, allowing you to categorize them within your AWS environment.

The following AWS services offer managed instances:
+ [EKS Auto Mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/automode.html)
+ [Amazon ECS managed instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ManagedInstances.html)
+ [WorkSpaces Core managed instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces-core/latest/pg/deploy-instances.html)
+ [Lambda managed instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-managed-instances.html)

## Billing for managed instances
<a name="billing-for-ec2-managed-instances"></a>

An Amazon EC2 managed instance incurs the same base charge as a non-managed Amazon EC2 instance, plus a separate fee for the service provider. This additional fee is charged by the service provider managing your instance and is billed separately. It covers the cost of services provided for operating and maintaining your managed instance. 

All [Amazon EC2 purchasing options](instance-purchasing-options.md) are available for managed instances, including On-Demand Instances, Reserved Instances, Spot Instances, and Savings Plans. By sourcing your compute directly from EC2 and then providing it to your service provider, you benefit from any existing Reserved Instances or Savings Plans applied to your account, ensuring that you're using the most cost-effective compute capacity available.

For example, when using Amazon EKS Auto Mode, you pay the standard EC2 instance rate for the underlying instances, plus an additional charge from Amazon EKS for managing the instances on your behalf. If you then decide to sign up for a [Savings Plans](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/what-is-savings-plans.html), the EC2 instance rate is reduced by the Savings Plans, while the additional charge from Amazon EKS remains unchanged.

## Identify managed instances
<a name="identify-ec2-managed-instances"></a>

Managed instances are identified by a **true** value in the **Managed** field. The service provider is identified in the **Operator** field (in the console) or `Principal` field (in the CLI).

Use the following procedures to identify managed instances.

------
#### [ Console ]

**To identify a managed instance**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**.

1. Select the instance you want to check.

1. On the **Details** tab (if you selected the checkbox) or in the summary area (if you selected the instance ID), find the **Managed** field.
   + A value of **true** indicates a managed instance.
   + A value of **false** indicates a non-managed instance.

1. If **Managed** is set to **true**, the **Operator** field displays a value identifying the service provider responsible for managing the instance. For example, a value of **eks.amazonaws.com** identifies Amazon EKS as the service provider.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**To identify a managed instance**  
Use the [describe-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html) command and specify the instance ID.

```
aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --instance-ids {{i-1234567890abcdef0}} \
    --query Reservations[].Instances[].Operator
```

The following is example output. If `Managed` is `true`, the instance is a managed instance and a `Principal` is included. The principal is the service provider that manages the instance. For example, a value of `eks.amazonaws.com` identifies Amazon EKS as the service provider.

```
[
    {
        "Managed": true,
        "Principal": "eks.amazonaws.com"
    }
]
```

**To find your managed instances**  
Use the [describe-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html) command and specify the `operator.managed` filter with a value of `true`. The `--query` option displays only the IDs of the managed instances.

```
aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=operator.managed,Values=true" \
    --query Reservations[*].Instances[].InstanceId
```

------
#### [ PowerShell ]

**To identify a managed instance**  
Use the [Get-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2Instance.html) cmdlet.

```
(Get-EC2Instance -InstanceId {{i-1234567890abcdef0}}).Instances.Operator
```

The following is example output.

```
Managed Principal
------- ---------
True    eks.amazonaws.com
```

**To find your managed instances**  
Use the [Get-EC2Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Get-EC2Instance.html) cmdlet. This example displays only the IDs of the managed instances.

```
(Get-EC2Instance -Filter @{Name="operator.managed"; Values="true"}).Instances.InstanceId
```

## Managed resource visibility settings
<a name="managed-resource-visibility-settings"></a>

You can control whether resources that AWS services provision on your behalf appear in your Amazon EC2 console views and API list operations.

### What is managed resource visibility?
<a name="what-is-managed-resource-visibility"></a>

AWS services such as Amazon EKS, Amazon ECS, WorkSpaces Core, AWS Lambda, and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore provision and operate Amazon EC2 instances directly within your account. These services assume responsibility for scaling, OS patches, security updates, and lifecycle management. The resulting Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EC2 launch templates, Amazon EBS volumes, snapshots, and network interfaces (ENIs) appear alongside your customer-managed resources in the Amazon EC2 console and APIs. Managed resource visibility settings give you control over whether these managed resources surface in your resource views.

### Affected resource types
<a name="managed-resource-visibility-affected-resource-types"></a>


| Resource type | Services that provision these resources | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Amazon EC2 instances | Amazon EKS worker nodes, Amazon ECS container instances, AWS Lambda execution environments, Amazon WorkSpaces Core, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore | Primary resource type affected by visibility settings | 
| Amazon EC2 launch templates | Amazon EKS, Amazon ECS, Amazon WorkSpaces Core, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore | Launch templates created by managed services | 
| Amazon EBS volumes | Amazon EKS, Amazon ECS, Amazon WorkSpaces Core, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, Amazon EC2 Fast Launch | Volumes attached to managed instances | 
| Amazon EBS snapshots | Amazon EC2 Fast Launch | Snapshots managed by Amazon EC2 Fast Launch | 
| Network interfaces (ENIs) | Amazon EKS, Amazon ECS, AWS Lambda, Amazon WorkSpaces Core, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, Amazon EC2 Application Status Checks | Network interfaces provisioned for managed workloads | 

**Note**  
By default, Amazon EC2 hides managed resources for accounts that did not have managed resources before visibility settings became available. For accounts that already had managed resources, Amazon EC2 sets the visibility setting to **Visible** to preserve existing workflows. The visibility setting applies to all managed resources in a Region, regardless of when they were created. You can change visibility settings at any time.

### Why configure visibility settings
<a name="managed-resource-visibility-why-configure"></a>

Configuring visibility settings lets you tailor how managed resources appear across your operational tooling. Common use cases include:
+ Simplify governance by reducing resource counts in compliance dashboards to only customer-managed resources.
+ Reduce noise in observability tools that aggregate Amazon EC2 metrics across all instances in an account.
+ Prevent false positives in cloud security posture management (CSPM) scanners (for example, Qualys) that flag managed resources as customer misconfigurations.
+ With managed instances, AWS is responsible for the configuration, patching, and health of Amazon EC2 instances. By controlling visibility, you can better articulate the shared responsibility model to end users.

**Note**  
Visibility settings control resource display in AWS console views and API list operations. They do not affect billing, resource operation, or actual access permissions. Hidden resources remain fully operational and billable.

### Configure managed resource visibility
<a name="configuring-managed-resource-visibility"></a>

You can configure the visibility of managed resources by using the Amazon EC2 console or the AWS CLI.

------
#### [ Console ]

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Dashboard**.

1. On the **Account attributes** card, under **Settings**, choose **Managed resources**.

1. Choose **Modify**.

1. Under **Default visibility**, choose one of the following options:
   + **Hidden (default)** – Hides all managed resources.
   + **Visible** – Shows all managed resources.

1. Choose **Modify visibility**.

------
#### [ AWS CLI ]

**Get current visibility settings**  
Use the [get-managed-resource-visibility](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/get-managed-resource-visibility.html) command to retrieve the current visibility configuration:

```
aws ec2 get-managed-resource-visibility
```

Example response:

```
{
    "visibility": {
        "defaultVisibility": "hidden"
    }
}
```

**Hide all managed resources**  
Use the [modify-managed-resource-visibility](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-managed-resource-visibility.html) command to hide all managed resources regardless of operator:

```
aws ec2 modify-managed-resource-visibility \
    --default-visibility "hidden"
```

------

### Discover hidden managed resources
<a name="discovering-hidden-managed-resources"></a>

When you turn off visibility, you can still access managed resources. The following methods surface them on demand:

1. **Service-specific consoles**: Navigate to the respective AWS service console (for example, the Amazon EKS console) to view instances provisioned for that service. The service console provides full details on all resources the service manages in your account.

1. **Direct API queries**: Use the `describe-instances` API with a specific `instance-id` parameter. Direct queries with known instance IDs return results regardless of visibility settings. Visibility settings only affect list and filter operations. You can also use `describe-instances` with the `include-managed-resources` parameter to discover managed instances.

**Note**  
The same direct-query-by-ID behavior applies to all affected resource types. You can use `describe-volumes`, `describe-launch-templates`, and `describe-network-interfaces` with specific resource IDs to access hidden managed resources of those types.

### EventBridge notifications
<a name="managed-resource-visibility-eventbridge"></a>

Managed resource visibility settings affect the events that Amazon EC2 emits to Amazon EventBridge. When visibility is **Hidden (default)**, Amazon EC2 does not emit `EC2 Instance State-change Notification` events to EventBridge for managed instances.

To receive these events for managed instances in EventBridge, set visibility to **Visible**.

For more information about changing this setting, see [Configure managed resource visibility](#configuring-managed-resource-visibility).

### Billing considerations
<a name="managed-resource-visibility-billing"></a>

Managed resource visibility settings have no effect on billing. Hidden managed instances continue to appear in billing data because they are resources running within your account, provisioned on your behalf, and remain fully billable regardless of visibility configuration.

Hidden resources remain visible in:
+ AWS bills
+ AWS Cost and Usage Reports

**Important**  
Managed instances are provisioned in your account and consume compute resources. Hiding them from console views does not reduce costs. Review service-specific billing documentation (for example, [Amazon EKS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/pricing/), [Amazon ECS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/pricing/)) for details on managed instance charges.

### Limitations
<a name="managed-resource-visibility-limitations"></a>
+ Visibility settings apply to the entire account and affect all IAM principals uniformly.
+ You cannot selectively show or hide managed resources by resource type or by the service that created them. For example, you cannot choose to show managed instances created by Amazon EKS while hiding those created by Lambda, Amazon ECS, or Amazon WorkSpaces.
