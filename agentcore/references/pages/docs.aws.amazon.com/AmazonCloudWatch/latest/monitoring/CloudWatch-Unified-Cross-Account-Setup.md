### Permissions needed to create links
<a name="Unified-Cross-Account-permissions-setup"></a>

To create links between a monitoring account and a source account, you must be signed in with certain permissions. 
+ **To set up a monitoring account** – You must have either full administrator access in the monitoring account, or you must sign in to that account with the following permissions:

### Permissions needed to monitor across accounts
<a name="Unified-Cross-Account-permissions-monitor"></a>

After a link has been created, to view source account information from a monitoring account, you must be signed in to an account with one of the following:
+ Full administrator access in the monitoring account
+ The following cross-account permissions, in addition to permissions to view the specific types of resources that you will be monitoring

  ```
  {
     "Sid": "AllowReadOnly",
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Action": [
       "oam:Get*",
       "oam:List*"
     ],
     "Resource": "*"
   }
  ```

## Setup overview
<a name="CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account-Setup-overview"></a>

The following high-level steps show you how to set up CloudWatch cross-account observability.

**Note**  
We recommend creating a new AWS account to use as your organization's monitoring account.

1. Set up a dedicated monitoring account.

1. (Optional) Download an CloudFormation template or copy a URL to link source accounts.

1. Link source accounts to the monitoring account.

After completing these steps, you can use the monitoring account to view the observability data of the source accounts.

## Step 1: Set up a monitoring account
<a name="Unified-Cross-Account-Setup-ConfigureMonitoringAccount"></a>

Follow the steps in this section to set up an AWS account as a monitoring account for CloudWatch cross-account observability.

**Prerequisites**
+ **If you're setting up accounts in an AWS Organizations organization as the source accounts** – Get the organization path or organization ID.
+ **If you're not using Organizations for the source accounts** – Get the account IDs of the source accounts.

To set up an account as a monitoring account, you must have certain permissions. For more information, see [Necessary permissions](#CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account-Setup-permissions).

**To set up a monitoring account**

1. Sign in to the account that you want to use as a monitoring account.

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Settings**.

1. By **Monitoring account configuration**, choose **Configure**.

1. For **Select data**, choose whether this monitoring account will be able to view **Logs**, **Metrics**, **Traces**, **Application Insights - Applications**, **Internet Monitor - Monitors**, and **Application Signals - Services, Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** data from the source accounts it is linked to.

1. For **List source accounts**, enter the source accounts that this monitoring account will view. To identify the source accounts, enter individual account IDs, organization paths, or organization IDs. If you enter an organization path or organization ID, this monitoring account is allowed to view observability data from all linked accounts in that organization.

   Separate the entries in this list with commas.
**Important**  
When you enter an organization path, follow the exact format. The ou-id must end with a `/` (a slash character). For example: `o-a1b2c3d4e5/r-f6g7h8i9j0example/ou-def0-awsbbbb/`

1. For **Define a label to use to identify your source account**, you can define alabel that is used to create a CloudFormation template. The label is then applied to source accounts when that template is used to link the source accounts to this monitoring account.

   You can specify whether to use account names or email addresses in this label, and also use variables such as `$AccountName`, `$AcccountEmail`, and `$AcccountEmailNoDomain`.
**Note**  
In the AWS GovCloud (US-East) and AWS GovCloud (US-West) Regions, the only supported option is to use custom labels, and the `$AccountName`, `$AcccountEmail`, and `$AcccountEmailNoDomain` variables all resolve as {{account-id}} instead of the specified variable.

1. Choose **Configure**.

**Important**  
The link between the monitoring and source accounts is not complete until you configure the source accounts. For more information, see the following sections.

## Step 2: (Optional) Download an CloudFormation template or URL
<a name="Unified-Cross-Account-Setup-TemplateOrURL"></a>

To link source accounts to a monitoring account, we recommend using an AWS CloudFormation template or a URL. 
+ **If you are linking an entire organization** – CloudWatch provides an CloudFormation template.
+ **If you are linking individual accounts** – Use either an CloudFormation template or a URL that CloudWatch provides.

To use an CloudFormation template, you must download it during these steps. After you link the monitoring account with at least one source account, the CloudFormation template is no longer available to download.

**To download an CloudFormation template or copy a URL for linking source accounts to the monitoring account**

1. Sign in to the account that you want to use as a monitoring account.

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Settings**.

1. By **Monitoring account configuration**, choose **Resources to link accounts**.

1. Do one of the following:
   + Choose **AWS organization** to get a template to use to link accounts in an organization to this monitoring account.
   + Choose **Any account** to get a template or URL for setting up individual accounts as source accounts.

1. Do one of the following:
   + If you chose **AWS organization**, choose **Download CloudFormation template**. 
   + If you chose **Any account**, choose either **Download CloudFormation template** or **Copy URL**.

1. (Optional) Repeat steps 5-6 to download both the CloudFormation template and the URL.

## Step 3: Link the source accounts
<a name="Unified-Cross-Account-Setup-ConfigureSourceAccount"></a>

Use the steps in these sections to link source accounts to a monitoring account.

To link monitoring accounts with source accounts, you must have certain permissions. For more information, see [Necessary permissions](#CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account-Setup-permissions).

### Use an CloudFormation template to set up all accounts in an organization or an organizational unit as source accounts
<a name="Unified-Cross-Account-SetupSource-OrgTemplate"></a>

These steps assume that you already downloaded the necessary CloudFormation template by performing the steps in [Step 2: (Optional) Download an CloudFormation template or URL](#Unified-Cross-Account-Setup-TemplateOrURL).

**To use an CloudFormation template to link accounts in an organization or organizational unit to the monitoring account**

1. Sign in to the organization's management account.

1. Open the CloudFormation console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

1. In the left navigation bar, choose **StackSets**.

1. Check that you are signed in to the Region that you want, then choose **Create StackSet**.

1. Choose **Next**.

1. Choose **Template is ready** and choose **Upload a template file**.

1. Choose **Choose file**, choose the template that you downloaded from the monitoring account, and choose **Open**.

1. Choose **Next**.

1. For **Specify StackSet details**, enter a name for the StackSet and choose **Next**.

1. For **Add stacks to stack set**, choose **Deploy new stacks**. 

1. For **Deployment targets**, choose whether to deploy to the entire organization or to specified organizational units.

1. For **Specify regions**, choose which Regions to deploy CloudWatch cross-account observability to.

1. Choose **Next**.

1. On the **Review** page, confirm your selected options and choose **Submit**.

1. In the **Stack instances** tab, refresh the screen until you see that your stack instances have the status **CREATE\_COMPLETE**.

### Use an CloudFormation template to set up individual source accounts
<a name="Unified-Cross-Account-SetupSource-SingleTemplate"></a>

These steps assume that you already downloaded the necessary CloudFormation template by performing the steps in [Step 2: (Optional) Download an CloudFormation template or URL](#Unified-Cross-Account-Setup-TemplateOrURL).

**To use an CloudFormation template to set up individual source accounts for CloudWatch cross-account observability**

1. Sign in to the source account.

1. Open the CloudFormation console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

1. In the left navigation bar, choose **Stacks**.

1. Check that you are signed in to the Region that you want, then choose **Create stack**, **With new resources (standard)**.

1. Choose **Next**.

1. Choose **Upload a template file**.

1. Choose **Choose file**, choose the template that you downloaded from the monitoring account, and choose **Open**.

1. Choose **Next**.

1. For **Specify stack details**, enter a name for the stack and choose **Next**.

1. On the **Configure stack options** page, choose **Next**.

1. On the **Review** page, choose **Submit**.

1. On the status page for your stack, refresh the screen until you see that your stack has the status **CREATE\_COMPLETE**.

1. To use this same template to link more source accounts to this monitoring account, sign out of this account and sign in to the next source account. Then repeat steps 2-12.

### Use a URL to set up individual source accounts
<a name="Unified-Cross-Account-SetupSource-SingleURL"></a>

These steps assume that you already copied the necessary URL by performing the steps in [Step 2: (Optional) Download an CloudFormation template or URL](#Unified-Cross-Account-Setup-TemplateOrURL).

**To use a URL to link individual source accounts to the monitoring account**

1. Sign in to the account that you want to use as a source account.

1. Enter the URL that you copied from the monitoring account.

   You see the CloudWatch settings page, with some information filled in.

1. For **Select data**, choose whether this source account will share **Logs**, **Metrics**, **Traces**, **Application Insights - Applications**, and **Internet Monitor - Monitors** data to this monitoring account.

   For both **Logs** and **Metrics**, you can choose whether to share all resources or a subset with the monitoring account.

   1. (Optional) To share a subset of this account's log groups with the monitoring account, select **Logs** and choose **Filter Logs**. Then use the **Filter Logs** box to construct a query to find the log groups that you want to share. The query will use the term `LogGroupName` and one or more of the following operands.
      + `=` and `!=`
      + `AND`
      + `OR`
      + `^` indicates LIKE and `!^` indicates NOT LIKE. These can be used only as prefix searches. Include a `%` at the end of the string that you want to search for and include.
      + `IN` and `NOT IN`, using parentheses (`( )`)

      The complete query must be no more than 2000 characters and is limited to five conditional operands. Conditional operands are `AND` and `OR`. There isn't a limit on the number of other operands.
**Tip**  
Choose **View sample queries** to see the correct syntax for common query formats.

   1. (Optional) To share a subset of this account's metric namespaces with the monitoring account, select **Metrics** and choose **Filter Metrics**. Then use the **Filter Metrics** box to construct a query to find the metric namespaces that you want to share. Use the term `Namespace` and one or more of the following operands.
      + `=` and `!=`
      + `AND`
      + `OR`
      + `LIKE` and `NOT LIKE`. These can be used only as prefix searches. Include a `%` at the end of the string that you want to search for and include.
      + `IN` and `NOT IN`, using parentheses (`( )`)

      The complete query must be no more than 2000 characters and is limited to five conditional operands. Conditional operands are `AND` and `OR`. There isn't a limit on the number of other operands.
**Tip**  
Choose **View sample queries** to see the correct syntax for common query formats.

1. Do not change the ARN in **Enter monitoring account configuration ARN**.

1. The **Define a label to identify your source account** section is pre-filled with the label choice from the monitoring account, if there is one. Optionally, choose **Edit** to change it.
**Note**  
In the AWS GovCloud (US-East) and AWS GovCloud (US-West) Regions, the only supported option is to use custom labels, and the `$AccountName`, `$AcccountEmail`, and `$AcccountEmailNoDomain` variables all resolve as {{account-id}} instead of the specified variable.

1. Choose **Link**.

1. Enter **Confirm** in the box and choose **Confirm**.

1. To use this same URL to link more source accounts to this monitoring account, sign out of this account and sign in to the next source account. Then repeat steps 2-7.
