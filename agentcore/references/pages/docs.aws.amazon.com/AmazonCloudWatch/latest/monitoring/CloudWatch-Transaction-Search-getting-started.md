# Enable transaction search

You can enable [Transaction Search](./CloudWatch-Transaction-Search.html) through the console or by using an API. Transaction search is configured for the entire account and switches all spans ingestion through X-Ray into cost effective collection mode using [Amazon CloudWatch Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/). By default you will also index 1% of ingested spans for free as trace summary for analysis, which is typically sufficient given you already have full end-to-end trace visibility on all ingested spans through Transaction Search.

## Prerequisites

Before you can enable Transaction Search, you must create a role with the following permissions.

      "Resource": "arn:aws:cloudtrail:*:*:channel/aws-service-channel/application-signals/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

###### Note

To use Transaction Search and other CloudWatch features, add the [CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess.html) to your role. For information about how to create a role, see [IAM role creation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create.html).

## Enabling Transaction Search in the console

The following procedure describes how to enable Transaction Search in the console.

###### To enable Transaction Search in the CloudWatch console

1.  Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).

2.  From the navigation pane, under **Application Signals**, choose **Transaction Search**.

3.  Choose **Enable Transaction Search**.

4.  Select the box to ingest spans as structured logs, and enter a percentage of spans to be indexed. You can index spans at 1% for free and change the percentage later based on your requirements.

## Enabling Transaction Search using an API

The following procedure describes how to enable Transaction Search using an API.

### Step 1. Create a policy that grants access to ingest spans in CloudWatch Logs

When using the AWS CLI or SDK to enable Transaction Search, you must configure permissions using a resource-based policy with [`PutResourcePolicy`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_PutResourcePolicy.html).

###### Example policy

The following example policy allows X-Ray to send traces to CloudWatch Logs

JSON  
****  
``` programlisting
{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "TransactionSearchXRayAccess",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "xray.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "logs:PutLogEvents",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123456789012:log-group:aws/spans:*",
                "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123456789012:log-group:/aws/application-signals/data:*"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "ArnLike": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:xray:us-east-1:123456789012:*"
                },
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceAccount": "123456789012"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

###### Example command

The following example shows how to format your AWS CLI command with `PutResourcePolicy`.

``` programlisting
aws logs put-resource-policy --policy-name MyResourcePolicy --policy-document '{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [ { "Sid": "TransactionSearchXRayAccess", "Effect": "Allow", "Principal": { "Service": "xray.amazonaws.com" }, "Action": "logs:PutLogEvents", "Resource": [ "arn:partition:logs:region:account-id:log-group:aws/spans:*", "arn:partition:logs:region:account-id:log-group:/aws/application-signals/data:*" ], "Condition": { "ArnLike": { "aws:SourceArn": "arn:partition:xray:region:account-id:*" }, "StringEquals": { "aws:SourceAccount": "account-id" } } } ]}'
```

### Step 2. Configure the destination of trace segments

Configure the ingestion of spans with [`UpdateTraceSegmentDestination`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_UpdateTraceSegmentDestination.html).

###### Example command

The following example shows how to format your AWS CLI command with `UpdateTraceSegmentDestination`.

``` programlisting
aws xray update-trace-segment-destination --destination CloudWatchLogs
```

### Step 3. Configure the amount of spans to index

Configure your desired sampling percentage with [`UpdateIndexingRule`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_UpdateIndexingRule.html)

###### Example command

The following example shows how to format your AWS CLI command with `UpdateIndexingRule`.

``` programlisting
aws xray update-indexing-rule --name "Default" --rule '{"Probabilistic": {"DesiredSamplingPercentage": number}}'
```

###### Note

After you enable Transaction Search, it can take 10 minutes for spans to become available for search and analysis.

### Step 4. Verify spans are available for search and analysis

To verify spans are available for search and analysis, use [`GetTraceSegmentDestination`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_GetTraceSegmentDestination.html).

###### Example commands

The following example shows how to format your AWS CLI command with `GetTraceSegmentDestination`.

``` programlisting
aws xray get-trace-segment-destination
```

###### Example response

The following example shows the response you can expect when Transaction Search is active.

``` programlisting
{
    "Destination": "CloudWatchLogs",
    "Status": "ACTIVE"
}
```
