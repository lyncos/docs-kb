# Installing the Amazon Q Developer extension or plugin in your IDE
<a name="q-in-IDE-setup"></a>

**End of support notice**  
On April 30, 2027, AWS will discontinue support for Amazon Q Developer IDE plugins. For capabilities similar to Amazon Q Developer IDE plugins, explore Kiro to access the latest models and features, including agentic coding, chat and MCP support. For more information, see [Amazon Q Developer IDE plugins end of support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/q-developer-ide-end-of-support.html).

To set up Amazon Q Developer in your integrated development environment (IDE), complete the following steps. After installing the Amazon Q extension or plugin, authenticate through IAM Identity Center or AWS Builder ID. You can use Amazon Q for free, without an AWS account, by authenticating with Builder ID. 

To get started, download the Amazon Q extension or plugin for your IDE:
+ [Download Amazon Q for Eclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/amazon-q)
+ [Download Amazon Q for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmazonWebServices.amazon-q-vscode)
+ [Download Amazon Q for JetBrains IDEs](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24267-amazon-q/)
+ [Download Amazon Q in the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmazonWebServices.AWSToolkitforVisualStudio2022)

**Note**  
In general, the default duration for a session that is authenticated through IAM Identity Center is 8 hours. However, in the case of Amazon Q, the default session lasts 90 days (if you set up IAM Identity Center on April 18, 2024 or later). For more information refer to [How to extend the session duration for Amazon Q in the IDE](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/configure-user-session.html#90-day-extended-session-duration) in the *AWS IAM Identity Center User Guide*

To sign in and authenticate, complete the steps in this section.

## Using an IAM principal in your AWS console
<a name="q-no-IAM-in-IDEs"></a>

Depending on how you use AWS, you may be accustomed to using your IAM credentials to sign in to the console for all AWS services. However, you cannot use Amazon Q Developer in the IDE as an IAM principal, or with an IAM role. You must authenticate with credentials from either IAM Identity Center or Builder ID.
