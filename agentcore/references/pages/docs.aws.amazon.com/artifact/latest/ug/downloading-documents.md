# Downloading reports in AWS Artifact
<a name="downloading-documents"></a>

You can download reports from the AWS Artifact console. When you download a report from AWS Artifact, the report is generated specifically for you, and every report has a unique watermark. For this reason, you should share the reports only with those you trust. Don't email the reports as attachments, and don't share them online. To share a report, use a secure sharing service such as Amazon WorkDocs. Some reports require you to accept the **Terms and conditions** before you can download them.

## Downloading a report
<a name="artifact-download-report"></a>

To download a report, you must have the required permissions. For more information, see [Identity and access management in AWS Artifact](security-iam.md).

When you sign up for AWS Artifact, your account is automatically granted permissions to download some reports. If you are having trouble accessing AWS Artifact, follow the guidance on [AWS Artifact Service Authorization Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_awsartifact.html) page.

**To download a report**

1. Open the AWS Artifact console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/artifact/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/artifact/). 

1. On the AWS Artifact home page, choose **View reports**.

   On the **Reports** page, on the **AWS reports** tab, you can access AWS reports (for example, SOC 1/2/3, PCI, C5, and so on). On the **Third-party reports** tab, you can access reports from independent software vendors (ISVs) who sell their products on AWS Marketplace.

1. (Optional) To find a report, enter a keyword in the search field. You can also perform targeted searches for reports based on individual columns, including report title, category, series, and description. For example, to find the Cloud Computing Compliance Controls Catalogue (C5) report, you can search the **Title** column using "Title", the "contains" operator (:), and the term "C5" (**Title : C5**).

1. (Optional) For more information about a report, choose the title of the report to open its details page.

1. (Optional) If you want to **download a previous version of a report**, you can open the details page of the report by choosing the report title. On the details page, look for the **Previous versions** section, and in the desired version row, choose **Download** to download that specific version of the report.

1. Select a report, and then choose **Download report**.

1. You might be prompted to accept terms and conditions (**Accept terms to download report**) for the specific report that you're downloading. We recommend that you read the terms and conditions closely. When you're finished reading, select **I have read and agree to the terms**, and then choose **Accept terms and download report**.

1. Open the downloaded file via a PDF viewer. Review the terms and conditions for acceptance and scroll down to find the audit report. Reports could have additional information embedded as attachments within the PDF document, so make sure to check for attachments within the PDF file for supporting documentation. For instructions on how to view attachments, see [Viewing attachments in PDF documents](#view-attachments-in-pdf). 

## Viewing attachments in PDF documents

1. Download the latest Firefox web browser from the Mozilla website at [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).

1. Open the PDF file in Firefox's built-in PDF viewer. For instructions, see [ View PDF files in Firefox or choose another viewer](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/view-pdf-files-firefox-or-choose-another-viewer) on the Mozilla Support website.

1. To view PDF attachments in Firefox's built-in PDF viewer, choose **Toggle Sidebar**, **Show Attachments**.

## Securing your documents
<a name="artifact-best-practices"></a>

AWS Artifact documents are confidential and should be kept secure at all times. AWS Artifact uses the AWS shared responsibility model for its documents. This means that AWS is responsible for keeping documents secure while they are in the AWS Cloud, but you are responsible for keeping them secure after you download them. AWS Artifact might require you to accept the **Terms and conditions** before you can download documents. Each document download has a unique, traceable watermark.

You are only permitted to share documents marked as confidential within your company, with your regulators, and with your auditors. You aren't permitted to share these documents with your customers or on your website. We strongly recommend that you use a secure document sharing service, such as Amazon WorkDocs, to share documents with others. Do not send the documents through email or upload them to a site that is not secure.
