# Control access to VPC endpoints using endpoint policies
<a name="vpc-endpoints-access"></a>

An endpoint policy is a resource-based policy that you attach to a VPC endpoint to control which AWS principals can use the endpoint to access an AWS service. 

An endpoint policy does not override or replace identity-based policies or resource-based policies. For example, if you're using an interface endpoint to connect to Amazon S3, you can also use Amazon S3 bucket policies to control access to buckets from specific endpoints or specific VPCs.

+ [Considerations](#vpc-endpoint-policy-considerations)
+ [Default endpoint policy](#default-endpoint-policy)
+ [Policies for interface endpoints](#vpc-endpoint-policies-interface)
+ [Principals for gateway endpoints](#vpc-endpoint-policies-gateway)
+ [Update a VPC endpoint policy](#update-vpc-endpoint-policy)

## Considerations
<a name="vpc-endpoint-policy-considerations"></a>
+ An endpoint policy is a JSON policy document that uses the IAM policy language. It must contain a [Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html) element. The size of an endpoint policy cannot exceed 20,480 characters, including white space.
+ When you create an interface or gateway endpoint for an AWS service, you can attach a single endpoint policy to the endpoint. You can [update the endpoint policy](#update-vpc-endpoint-policy) at any time. If you don't attach an endpoint policy, we attach the [default endpoint policy](#default-endpoint-policy).
+ Not all AWS services support endpoint policies. If an AWS service doesn't support endpoint policies, we allow full access to any endpoint for the service. For more information, see [View endpoint policy support](aws-services-privatelink-support.md#vpce-endpoint-policy-support).
+ When you create a VPC endpoint for an endpoint service other than an AWS service, we allow full access to the endpoint.
+ You can't use wildcard characters (\* or ?) or [numeric condition operators](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.html#Conditions_Numeric) with global context keys that reference system-generated identifiers (for example, `aws:PrincipalAccount` or `aws:SourceVpc`).
+ When you use a [string condition operator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.html#Conditions_String), you must use at least six consecutive characters before or after each wildcard character.
+ When you specify an ARN in a resource or condition element, the account portion of the ARN can include an account ID or a wildcard character, but not both.
+ After you update an endpoint policy, it can take a few minutes for the changes to take effect.

## Default endpoint policy
<a name="default-endpoint-policy"></a>

The default endpoint policy grants full access to the endpoint.

```
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Policies for interface endpoints
<a name="vpc-endpoint-policies-interface"></a>

For example endpoint policies for AWS services, see [AWS services that integrate with AWS PrivateLink](aws-services-privatelink-support.md). The first column in the table contains links to AWS PrivateLink documentation for each AWS service. If an AWS service supports endpoint policies, its documentation includes example endpoint policies.

## Principals for gateway endpoints
<a name="vpc-endpoint-policies-gateway"></a>

With gateway endpoints, the `Principal` element must be set to `*`. To specify a principal, use the `aws:PrincipalArn` condition key.

```
"Condition": {
    "StringEquals": {
        "aws:PrincipalArn": "{{arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/endpointuser}}"
    }
}
```

If you specify the principal in the following format, access is granted to the AWS account root user only, not all users and roles for the account.

```
"AWS": "{{account_id}}"
```

For example endpoint policies for gateway endpoints, see the following:
+ [Endpoints for Amazon S3](vpc-endpoints-s3.md#edit-vpc-endpoint-policy-s3)
+ [Endpoints for DynamoDB](vpc-endpoints-ddb.md#iam-policies-ddb)

## Update a VPC endpoint policy
<a name="update-vpc-endpoint-policy"></a>

Use the following procedure to update an endpoint policy for an AWS service. After you update an endpoint policy, it can take a few minutes for the changes to take effect.

**To update an endpoint policy using the console**

1. Open the Amazon VPC console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Endpoints**.

1. Select the VPC endpoint.

1. Choose **Actions**, **Manage policy**.

1. Choose **Full Access** to allow full access to the service, or choose **Custom** and attach a custom policy.

1. Choose **Save**.

**To update an endpoint policy using the command line**
+ [modify-vpc-endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-vpc-endpoint.html) (AWS CLI)
+ [Edit-EC2VpcEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Edit-EC2VpcEndpoint.html) (Tools for Windows PowerShell)
