# Sign in to the AWS Management Console
<a name="how-to-sign-in"></a>

When you sign in to the AWS Management Console from the main AWS sign-in URL ([https://console.aws.amazon.com/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)) you must choose your user type: **Root user**, **IAM user**, or **project user**. If you're not sure what kind of user you are, see [Determine your user type](user-types-list.md).

 The [root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/account-root-user-type.html) has unrestricted account access and is associated with the person who created the AWS account. The root user then creates other types of users, such as IAM users and users in AWS IAM Identity Center, and assigns them access credentials.

A project user is someone who accesses a project. Projects are only available if you use our new AWS experience. When you're a project user, you also have access to AWS Settings. We're currently releasing our new experience to a limited number of customers. You might not be able to access this experience yet.

An [IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/iam-user-type.html) is an identity within your AWS account that has specific custom permissions. When an IAM user signs in, they can use a sign-in URL that includes their AWS account or alias, such as ` https://{{account_alias_or_id}}.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/` instead of the main AWS sign in URL `[https://console.aws.amazon.com/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)`.

You can sign in to up to 5 different identities simultaneously in a single browser in the AWS Management Console. These can be a combination of root users, IAM users, or federated roles in different accounts or in the same account. If you sign in to a project, this is automatically enabled and can't be turned off. For details, see [Signing in to multiple accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/multisession.html) in the *AWS Management Console Getting Started Guide*.

If you're not sure what kind of user you are, see [Determine your user type](user-types-list.md).
