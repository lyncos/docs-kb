# Export a REST API from API Gateway
<a name="api-gateway-export-api"></a>

 Once you created and configured a REST API in API Gateway, using the API Gateway console or otherwise, you can export it to an OpenAPI file using the API Gateway Export API, which is part of the Amazon API Gateway Control Service. To use the API Gateway Export API, you need to sign your API requests. For more information about signing requests, see [Signing AWS API requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-signing.html) in the *IAM User Guide*. You have options to include the API Gateway integration extensions, as well as the [Postman](https://www.postman.com) extensions, in the exported OpenAPI definition file. 

**Note**  
When exporting the API using the AWS CLI, be sure to include the extensions parameter as shown in the following example, to ensure that the `x-amazon-apigateway-request-validator` extension is included:  

```
aws apigateway get-export --parameters extensions='apigateway' --rest-api-id abcdefg123 --stage-name dev --export-type swagger latestswagger2.json
```

 You cannot export an API if its payloads are not of the `application/json` type. If you try, you will get an error response stating that JSON body models are not found. 

## Request to export a REST API
<a name="api-gateway-export-api-request"></a>

 With the Export API, you export an existing REST API by submitting a GET request, specifying the to-be-exported API as part of URL paths. The request URL is of the following format: 

------
#### [ OpenAPI 3.0 ]

```
 https://{{<host>}}/restapis/{{<restapi_id>}}/stages/{{<stage_name>}}/exports/oas30
```

------
#### [ OpenAPI 2.0 ]

```
 https://{{<host>}}/restapis/{{<restapi_id>}}/stages/{{<stage_name>}}/exports/swagger
```

------

 You can append the `extensions` query string to specify whether to include API Gateway extensions (with the `integration` value) or Postman extensions (with the `postman` value). 

 In addition, you can set the `Accept` header to `application/json` or `application/yaml` to receive the API definition output in JSON or YAML format, respectively. 

 For more information about submitting GET requests using the API Gateway Export API, see [GetExport](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/api/API_GetExport.html). 

**Note**  
 If you define models in your API, they must be for the content type of "application/json" for API Gateway to export the model. Otherwise, API Gateway throws an exception with the "Only found non-JSON body models for ..." error message.   
 Models must contain properties or be defined as a particular JSONSchema type. 

## Download REST API OpenAPI definition in JSON
<a name="api-gateway-export-api-download-swagger-json"></a>

To export and download a REST API in OpenAPI definitions in JSON format:

------
#### [ OpenAPI 3.0 ]

```
GET /restapis/{{<restapi_id>}}/stages/{{<stage_name>}}/exports/oas30

```

------
#### [ OpenAPI 2.0 ]

```
GET /restapis/{{<restapi_id>}}/stages/{{<stage_name>}}/exports/swagger
Host: apigateway.{{<region>}}.amazonaws.com
Accept: application/json
```

------

 Here, `{{<region>}}` could be, for example, `us-east-1`. For all the regions where API Gateway is available, see [Regions and Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#apigateway_region).

## Export REST API using the API Gateway console
<a name="api-gateway-export-api-from-console"></a>

After [deploying your REST API to a stage](set-up-deployments.md#create-deployment), you can proceed to export the API in the stage to an OpenAPI file using the API Gateway console.

 In the **Stages** pane in the API Gateway console, choose **Stage actions**, **Export**.

Specify an **API specification type**, **Format**, and **Extensions** to download your API's OpenAPI definition.
