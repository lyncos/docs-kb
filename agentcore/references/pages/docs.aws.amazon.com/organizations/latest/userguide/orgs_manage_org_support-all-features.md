# Enabling all features for an organization with AWS Organizations
<a name="orgs_manage_org_support-all-features"></a>

AWS Organizations has two available feature sets:
+ [All features](orgs_getting-started_concepts.md#feature-set-all) – This feature set is the preferred and default way to work with AWS Organizations, and it includes all the features of consolidating billing. When you create an organization, enabling all features is the default. With all features enabled, you can use the advanced account management features available in Organizations such as [integration with supported AWS services](orgs_integrate_services_list.md) and [organization policies](orgs_manage_policies.md).
+ [Consolidated billing features](orgs_getting-started_concepts.md#feature-set-cb-only) – This feature set is limited to generating a single bill across an organization. No other management capabilities are available with consolidated billing.

If you create an organization with the consolidated billing feature set, you can later enable all features. However, you cannot migrate from all features to consolidated billing after all features is enabled.

**Check which feature set is currently enabled**

To determine which feature set your organization currently uses, run the AWS Organizations [DescribeOrganization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeOrganization.html) operation (for example, the `aws organizations describe-organization` AWS CLI command). The `FeatureSet` field in the response is either `ALL` or `CONSOLIDATED_BILLING`. You can also view the feature set on the *Settings* page of the AWS Organizations console.

**Standard migration and assisted migration**

The two approaches for migrating to all features are *standard migration* and* assisted migration*.

Standard migration is the self-service process available to all AWS Organizations customers to enable the all features mode.

Assisted migration is the process available to Enterprise Support plan customers to request that AWS migrate their organization to the all features mode on your behalf.

**Note**  
**One-way processes and rollback processes**  
The migration from consolidated billing features to all features is one-way. You can't switch an organization with all features enabled back to consolidated billing features only.
After you have begun the assisted migration process, it cannot be rolled back. You will need to wait 90 days until the process expires if you want to go through the standard process instead.

## Considerations
<a name="before-enabling-all"></a>

Before changing from an organization that supports only consolidated billing features to an organization supporting all features, consider the following:

**Invited accounts must approve the migration**

When you start the process to enable all features, AWS Organizations sends a request to every member account that you *invited* to join your organization. Every invited account must approve enabling all features by accepting the request. Only then can you complete the process to enable all features in your organization. If an account declines the request, you must either remove the account from your organization or resend the request. The request must be accepted before you can complete the process to enable all features. Accounts that you *created* using AWS Organizations don't get a request because they don't need to approve the additional control. 

**Invited accounts are notified which feature set is currently enabled**

The owner of an invited account is informed by the invitation whether they are joining an organization with consolidated billing only, or with all features enabled. You can continue inviting accounts to your organization while enabling all features.

If you invite an account *during* the process to enable all features, the invitation states that the organization they are joining has all features enabled. If you cancel the process to enable all features before the account accepts the invitation, that invitation is canceled. You must invite the account again to be a member of an organization with consolidated billing features only.

If you invite an account and the invitation is not yet accepted *before* you begin the process to enable all features, that invitation is canceled because the invitation states that the organization has consolidated billing features only. You must invite the account again to be a member of an organization with all features enabled. 

**The process of creating accounts in an organization is unaffected by the migration**

You can continue creating accounts in the organization. That process isn't affected by this change.

**The service-linked role `AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations` is required**

AWS Organizations verifies that every member account has a service-linked role named `AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations`. This role is mandatory in all accounts to enable all features. If you deleted the role in an invited account, accepting the invitation to enable all features recreates the role. If you deleted the role in an account that was created using AWS Organizations, that account receives an invitation specifically to recreate that role. All of these invitations must be accepted for the organization to complete the process of enabling all features.
