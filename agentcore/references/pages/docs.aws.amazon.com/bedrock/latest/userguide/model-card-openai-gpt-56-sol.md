## Endpoints and APIs supported
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-56-sol-apis-endpoints"></a>

The following tables show which endpoints and APIs are supported for GPT-5.6 Sol. For more information, see [APIs supported by Amazon Bedrock](apis.md) and [Endpoints supported by Amazon Bedrock](endpoints.md).

**Endpoint support**

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| ![not-supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/images/icons/icon-no.png) | ![supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/images/icons/icon-yes.png) | ![supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/images/icons/icon-yes.png) | ![not-supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/images/icons/icon-no.png) | ![not-supported](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/images/icons/icon-no.png) | 

**Note**  
On `bedrock-mantle`, both APIs use the `/openai/v1` base path, not `/v1`. Use either API with this model:  
For Responses, use `/openai/v1/responses`.
For Chat Completions, use `/openai/v1/chat/completions`.

**Tip**  
Whenever possible, we recommend using the `bedrock-runtime` endpoint for new applications. See [Endpoints supported by Amazon Bedrock](endpoints.md) for details.

## Pricing
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-56-sol-pricing"></a>

All prices are in USD per 1 million tokens for the Standard tier.

Commercial In-Region prices include a 10% fee over OpenAI rates. You do not need to add this fee.

*Priority and Flex tiers are not supported for this model.*

### Commercial Regions — short context (272K input tokens or fewer)
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-56-sol-pricing-commercial-short"></a>


| **Inference option** | **Input** | **Input — 30m cache write** | **Input — cache read** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| In-Region | $4.40 | $5.50 | $0.44 | $22.00 | 
| Geo CRIS | $4.40 | $5.50 | $0.44 | $22.00 | 
| Global CRIS | $4.00 | $5.00 | $0.40 | $20.00 | 

### Commercial Regions — long context (more than 272K input tokens)
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-56-sol-pricing-commercial-long"></a>


| **Inference option** | **Input** | **Input — 30m cache write** | **Input — cache read** | **Output** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| In-Region | $8.80 | $11.00 | $0.88 | $33.00 | 
| Geo CRIS | $8.80 | $11.00 | $0.88 | $33.00 | 
| Global CRIS | $8.00 | $10.00 | $0.80 | $30.00 | 

## Programmatic Access
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-56-sol-programmatic-access"></a>

Use the following model IDs and endpoint URLs to access this model programmatically. For more information about the available APIs and endpoints, see [APIs supported](apis.html) and [Endpoints supported](endpoints.html).


| **Endpoint** | **Model ID** | **In-Region endpoint URL** | **Geo inference ID** | **Global inference ID** | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| bedrock-runtime | openai.gpt-5.6-sol | Not supported | us.openai.gpt-5.6-sol | global.openai.gpt-5.6-sol | 
| bedrock-mantle | openai.gpt-5.6-sol | https://bedrock-mantle.{region}.api.aws/openai/v1 | Not supported | Not supported | 

*For example, if region is us-east-1 (N. Virginia), then the bedrock-mantle endpoint URL will be "https://bedrock-mantle.us-east-1.api.aws/openai/v1". On `bedrock-runtime`, the base URL is "https://bedrock-runtime.{region}.amazonaws.com/openai/v1" and requests must name the geographic cross-Region inference ID `us.openai.gpt-5.6-sol` as the model.*

## Service Tiers
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-56-sol-tiers"></a>

Amazon Bedrock offers multiple service tiers to match your workload requirements. **Standard** provides pay-per-token access with no commitment (set `"service_tier": "default"` or omit the field). **Priority** delivers the fastest response times for a price premium (set `"service_tier": "priority"`). **Flex** provides lower-cost access for flexible, non-time-sensitive workloads (set `"service_tier": "flex"`). **Reserved** provides dedicated throughput with a term commitment for predictable workloads; it is set at the account level rather than per request (contact your AWS account team to enable). For more information, see [service tiers](service-tiers-inference.html).


| **Standard** | **Priority** | **Flex** | **Reserved** |

## Regional Availability
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-56-sol-regional-availability"></a>

***Regional availability at a glance***

Amazon Bedrock offers three inference options: **In-Region** keeps requests within a single Region for strict compliance, **Geo Cross-Region** routes across Regions within a geography (such as US, EU, and APAC) while respecting data residency, and **Global Cross-Region** routes anywhere worldwide when there are no residency constraints. Refer to the [Regional availability by models](models-region-compatibility.md) page for more details.

Availability differs by endpoint.

## Quotas and Limits
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-56-sol-quotas"></a>

Your AWS account has default quotas to maintain the performance of the service and to ensure appropriate usage of Amazon Bedrock. The default quotas assigned to an account might be updated depending on regional factors, payment history, fraudulent usage, and/or approval of a quota [increase request](quotas-increase.html). For more information, see [Quotas for Amazon Bedrock](quotas.md) documentation and see the [limits](/general/latest/gr/bedrock.html#limits_bedrock) for the model.

On the `bedrock-runtime` endpoint, limits are managed as tokens per minute (TPM) with a 10x burndown rate, where 1 output token consumes 10 tokens.

## Sample Code
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-56-sol-sample-code"></a>

**Step 1 - AWS Account:** If you have an AWS account already, skip this step. If you are new to AWS, sign up for an [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).

**Step 2 - API key:** Go to the [Amazon Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home#/api-keys/long-term/create) and generate a long-term API key.

**Step 3 - Get the SDK:** To use this getting started guide, you must have Python already installed. Then install the relevant software depending on the APIs you are using.

For both APIs, choose the OpenAI SDK tab.

------
#### [ OpenAI SDK ]

```
pip install openai
```

------

### Step 4 - Set environment variables
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-56-sol-sample-code-environment"></a>

Configure your environment to use the API key for authentication.

------
#### [ bedrock-runtime ]

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="<provide your Bedrock API key>"
OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://bedrock-runtime.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/openai/v1"
```

------
#### [ bedrock-mantle ]

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="<provide your Bedrock API key>"
OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://bedrock-mantle.us-east-1.api.aws/openai/v1"
```

------

**Note**  
On `bedrock-runtime`, name a cross-Region inference profile as the model — `us.openai.gpt-5.6-sol` or `global.openai.gpt-5.6-sol`. This model is not available for in-Region inference on that endpoint. Your IAM identity also needs `bedrock:InvokeModel` on your account's default project (`arn:aws:bedrock:{region}:{account-id}:project/default`) in addition to the inference profile.

### Step 5 - Run your first inference request
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-56-sol-sample-code-request"></a>

Save the file as `bedrock-first-request.py`

#### bedrock-runtime: OpenAI SDK
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-56-sol-sample-code-runtime-openai"></a>

Use the settings from [Step 4 - Set environment variables](#model-card-openai-gpt-56-sol-sample-code-environment). Choose the `bedrock-runtime` tab. Both examples use the global system inference profile.

------
#### [ Responses API ]

```
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="global.openai.gpt-5.6-sol",
    input="Can you explain the features of Amazon Bedrock?"
)
print(response)
```

------
#### [ Chat ]

```
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="global.openai.gpt-5.6-sol",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain the features of Amazon Bedrock?"}]
)
print(response)
```

------

#### bedrock-mantle
<a name="model-card-openai-gpt-56-sol-sample-code-mantle"></a>

Use the settings from [Step 4 - Set environment variables](#model-card-openai-gpt-56-sol-sample-code-environment). Choose the `bedrock-mantle` tab. The Chat tab uses the Chat Completions API.

------
#### [ Responses API ]

```
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="openai.gpt-5.6-sol",
    input="Can you explain the features of Amazon Bedrock?"
)
print(response)
```

------
#### [ Chat ]

```
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai.gpt-5.6-sol",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain the features of Amazon Bedrock?"}]
)
print(response)
```
