# Remove PII from conversations by using sensitive information filters
<a name="guardrails-sensitive-filters"></a>

 Amazon Bedrock Guardrails helps detect sensitive information, such as personally identifiable information (PII), in input prompts or model responses using sensitive information filters. This filter is a probabilistic machine learning (ML) based solution that is context-dependent and detects sensitive information based on the context within input prompts or model responses. You can configure by selecting from a set of built-in PIIs offered by Amazon Bedrock Guardrails specific to your use case or organization by defining it along with regular expressions (custom regex) that work based on pattern matching to block or mask PII data. 

**Note**  
This filter evaluates text content only. In tool use (function calling) workloads, it does not evaluate the following, so PII in these fields is neither blocked nor masked:  
PII the model generates into tool call arguments (`toolUse.input` in Converse, `tool_use` parameters in InvokeModel). For example, if the model passes a customer's email address to a tool that writes a file, that address is not masked.
PII in tool results your application returns to the model (`toolResult`).
PII in the tool definitions you supply (`toolSpec.description`, `toolSpec.inputSchema`).

Sensitive information detection works across both natural language and code domains, including code syntax, comments, string literals, and hybrid content. This helps identify PII embedded in code elements such as variable names, hardcoded credentials, or code documentation.

You can configure the following modes for handling sensitive information that guardrails detects:
+ **Block** — Sensitive information filter policies can block requests or responses that include sensitive information. Examples of such applications might include general questions and answers based on public documents. If sensitive information is detected in the prompt or response, the guardrail blocks all the content and returns a message that you configure.
+ **Mask** — Sensitive information filter policies can anonymize or redact information from model requests or responses. For example, guardrails mask PIIs while generating summaries of conversations between users and customer service agents. If sensitive information is detected in the model request or response, the guardrail masks it and replaces it with the PII type (for example, `{NAME}` or `{EMAIL}`).

Amazon Bedrock Guardrails offers the following PIIs to block or anonymize:
+ **General**
  + **ADDRESS**

    A physical address, such as "100 Main Street, Anytown, USA" or "Suite \#12, Building 123". An address can include information such as the street, building, location, city, state, country, county, zip code, precinct, and neighborhood. Isolated mentions of city, state, country are not considered as valid addresses. 
  + **AGE**

    An individual's age, including the quantity and unit of time. For example, in the phrase "I am 40 years old," Amazon Bedrock Guardrails recognizes "40 years" as an age. 
  + **NAME**

    An individual's name. This entity type does not include titles, such as Dr., Mr., Mrs., or Miss. Amazon Bedrock Guardrails does not apply this entity type to names that are part of organizations or addresses. For example, guardrails recognizes the "John Doe Organization" as an organization, and it recognizes "Jane Doe Street" as an address. 
  + **EMAIL**

    An email address, such as *marymajor@email.com*.
  + **PHONE**

    A phone number. This entity type also includes fax and pager numbers. 
  + **USERNAME**

    A user name that identifies an account, such as a login name, screen name, nick name, or handle. 
  + **PASSWORD**

    An alphanumeric string that is used as a password, such as "\**very20special\#pass\**". 
  + **DRIVER\_ID**

    The number assigned to a driver's license, which is an official document permitting an individual to operate one or more motorized vehicles on a public road. A driver's license number consists of alphanumeric characters. 
  + **LICENSE\_PLATE**

    A license plate for a vehicle is issued by the state or country where the vehicle is registered. The format for passenger vehicles is typically five to eight digits, consisting of upper-case letters and numbers. The format varies depending on the location of the issuing state or country. 
  + **VEHICLE\_IDENTIFICATION\_NUMBER**

    A Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) uniquely identifies a vehicle. VIN content and format are defined in the *ISO 3779* specification. Each country has specific codes and formats for VINs. 
+ **Finance**
  + **CREDIT\_DEBIT\_CARD\_CVV**

    A three-digit card verification code (CVV) that is present on VISA, MasterCard, and Discover credit and debit cards. For American Express credit or debit cards, the CVV is a four-digit numeric code. 
  + **CREDIT\_DEBIT\_CARD\_EXPIRY**

    The expiration date for a credit or debit card. This number is usually four digits long and is often formatted as *month/year* or *MM/YY*. Amazon Bedrock Guardrails recognizes expiration dates such as *01/21*, *01/2021*, and *Jan 2021*. 
  + **CREDIT\_DEBIT\_CARD\_NUMBER**

    The number for a credit or debit card. These numbers can vary from 13 to 16 digits in length. However, Amazon Bedrock also recognizes credit or debit card numbers when only the last four digits are present. 
  + **PIN**

    A personal identification number (PIN) that could be 4 or 5 digits in length. As an example, these numbers are used to access bank accounts.
  + **INTERNATIONAL\_BANK\_ACCOUNT\_NUMBER**

    An International Bank Account Number has specific formats in each country. For more information, see [www.iban.com/structure](https://www.iban.com/structure).
  + **SWIFT\_CODE**

    A SWIFT code is a standard format of Bank Identifier Code (BIC) used to specify a particular bank or branch. Banks use these codes for money transfers such as international wire transfers.

    SWIFT codes consist of eight or 11 characters. The 11-digit codes refer to specific branches, while eight-digit codes (or 11-digit codes ending in 'XXX') refer to the head or primary office.
+ **IT**
  + **IP\_ADDRESS**

    An IPv4 address, such as *198.51.100.0*. 
  + **MAC\_ADDRESS**

    A *media access control* (MAC) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC). 
  + **URL**

    A web address, such as *www.example.com*. 
  + **AWS\_ACCESS\_KEY**

    A unique identifier that's associated with a secret access key; you use the access key ID and secret access key to sign programmatic AWS requests cryptographically. 
  + **AWS\_SECRET\_KEY**

    A unique identifier that's associated with an access key. You use the access key ID and secret access key to sign programmatic AWS requests cryptographically.

  + **US\_INDIVIDUAL\_TAX\_IDENTIFICATION\_NUMBER**

    A US Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) is a nine-digit number that starts with a "9" and contain a "7" or "8" as the fourth digit. An ITIN can be formatted with a space or a dash after the third and forth digits. 
  + **US\_PASSPORT\_NUMBER**

    A US passport number. Passport numbers range from six to nine alphanumeric characters. 
  + **US\_SOCIAL\_SECURITY\_NUMBER**

    A US Social Security Number (SSN) is a nine-digit number that is issued to US citizens, permanent residents, and temporary working residents. 
+ **Canada specific**
  + **CA\_HEALTH\_NUMBER**

    A Canadian Health Service Number is a 10-digit unique identifier, required for individuals to access healthcare benefits. 
  + **CA\_SOCIAL\_INSURANCE\_NUMBER**

    A Canadian Social Insurance Number (SIN) is a nine-digit unique identifier, required for individuals to access government programs and benefits.

    The SIN is formatted as three groups of three digits, such as *123-456-789*. A SIN can be validated through a simple check-digit process called the [Luhn algorithm](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm).
+ **UK Specific**
  + **UK\_NATIONAL\_HEALTH\_SERVICE\_NUMBER**

    A UK National Health Service Number is a 10-17 digit number, such as *485 777 3456*. The current system formats the 10-digit number with spaces after the third and sixth digits. The final digit is an error-detecting checksum.
  + **UK\_NATIONAL\_INSURANCE\_NUMBER**

    A UK National Insurance Number (NINO) provides individuals with access to National Insurance (social security) benefits. It is also used for some purposes in the UK tax system.

    The number is nine digits long and starts with two letters, followed by six numbers and one letter. A NINO can be formatted with a space or a dash after the two letters and after the second, forth, and sixth digits.
  + **UK\_UNIQUE\_TAXPAYER\_REFERENCE\_NUMBER**

    A UK Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) is a 10-digit number that identifies a taxpayer or a business. 
+ **Custom**
  + **Regex filter**

    You can use regular expressions to define patterns for a guardrail to recognize and act upon such as serial number, booking ID, or other custom patterns.

**Note**  
The PII model performs more effectively when it is provided with sufficient context. To enhance its accuracy, include more contextual information and avoid submitting single words or short phrases to the model. Since PII can be context-dependent (for example. a string of digits might represent an AWS KMS key or a user ID depending on the surrounding information), providing comprehensive context is crucial for accurate identification. 

**Note**  
PII masking applies only to content that is sent to the inference model (input prompts) and content that is returned from the inference model (model responses). It does not apply to the following:  
**Model invocation logs** — If you enabled [Monitor model invocation using CloudWatch Logs and Amazon S3](model-invocation-logging.md), the `input` field in Amazon CloudWatch Logs always contains the original, unmodified request regardless of guardrail intervention. To protect sensitive information in your logs, use [Amazon CloudWatch log data protection](AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/mask-sensitive-log-data.html).
**Guardrails trace output** — The `match` field in [GuardrailPiiEntityFilter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_GuardrailPiiEntityFilter.html) that is returned in API responses (such as the `trace` object of the Converse API) contains the original PII value, not the masked output. This behavior is by design so that your application can use the detection result for its own logic.

**Note**  
A custom regex filter of sensitive information filters does not support a regex lookaround match. 

## Configure sensitive information policy for your guardrail
<a name="guardrails-sensitive-information-policy-configure"></a>

You can configure sensitive information policies for your guardrail by using the AWS Management Console or Amazon Bedrock API.
