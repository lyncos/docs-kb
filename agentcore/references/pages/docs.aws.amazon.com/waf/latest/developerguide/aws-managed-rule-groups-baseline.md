**Introducing a new console experience for AWS WAF**

You can now use the updated experience to access AWS WAF functionality anywhere in the console. For more details, see [Working with the console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/working-with-console.html). 

# Baseline rule groups
<a name="aws-managed-rule-groups-baseline"></a>

Baseline managed rule groups provide general protection against a wide variety of common threats. Choose one or more of these rule groups to establish baseline protection for your resources. 

## Core rule set (CRS) managed rule group
<a name="aws-managed-rule-groups-baseline-crs"></a>

VendorName: `AWS`, Name: `AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet`, WCU: 700

**Note**  
This documentation covers the most recent static version release of this managed rule group. We report version changes in the changelog log at [AWS Managed Rules changelog](aws-managed-rule-groups-changelog.md). For information about other versions, use the API command [DescribeManagedRuleGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeManagedRuleGroup.html).   
The information that we publish for the rules in the AWS Managed Rules rule groups is intended to provide you with what you need to use the rules without giving bad actors what they need to circumvent the rules.   
If you need more information than you find here, contact the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/). 

The core rule set (CRS) rule group contains rules that are generally applicable to web applications. This provides protection against exploitation of a wide range of vulnerabilities, including some of the high risk and commonly occurring vulnerabilities described in OWASP publications such as [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/). Consider using this rule group for any AWS WAF use case.

This managed rule group adds labels to the web requests that it evaluates, which are available to rules that run after this rule group in your protection pack (web ACL). AWS WAF also records the labels to Amazon CloudWatch metrics. For general information about labels and label metrics, see [Web request labeling](waf-labels.md) and [Label metrics and dimensions](waf-metrics.md#waf-metrics-label).

## Admin protection managed rule group
<a name="aws-managed-rule-groups-baseline-admin"></a>

VendorName: `AWS`, Name: `AWSManagedRulesAdminProtectionRuleSet`, WCU: 100

**Note**  
This documentation covers the most recent static version release of this managed rule group. We report version changes in the changelog log at [AWS Managed Rules changelog](aws-managed-rule-groups-changelog.md). For information about other versions, use the API command [DescribeManagedRuleGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeManagedRuleGroup.html).   
The information that we publish for the rules in the AWS Managed Rules rule groups is intended to provide you with what you need to use the rules without giving bad actors what they need to circumvent the rules.   
If you need more information than you find here, contact the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/). 

The Admin protection rule group contains rules that allow you to block external access to exposed administrative pages. This might be useful if you run third-party software or want to reduce the risk of a malicious actor gaining administrative access to your application.

This managed rule group adds labels to the web requests that it evaluates, which are available to rules that run after this rule group in your protection pack (web ACL). AWS WAF also records the labels to Amazon CloudWatch metrics. For general information about labels and label metrics, see [Web request labeling](waf-labels.md) and [Label metrics and dimensions](waf-metrics.md#waf-metrics-label).

VendorName: `AWS`, Name: `AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet`, WCU: 200

**Note**  
This documentation covers the most recent static version release of this managed rule group. We report version changes in the changelog log at [AWS Managed Rules changelog](aws-managed-rule-groups-changelog.md). For information about other versions, use the API command [DescribeManagedRuleGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeManagedRuleGroup.html).

If you need more information than you find here, contact the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/). 

The Known bad inputs rule group contains rules to block request patterns that are known to be invalid and are associated with exploitation or discovery of vulnerabilities. This can help reduce the risk of a malicious actor discovering a vulnerable application.

This managed rule group adds labels to the web requests that it evaluates, which are available to rules that run after this rule group in your protection pack (web ACL). AWS WAF also records the labels to Amazon CloudWatch metrics. For general information about labels and label metrics, see [Web request labeling](waf-labels.md) and [Label metrics and dimensions](waf-metrics.md#waf-metrics-label).
