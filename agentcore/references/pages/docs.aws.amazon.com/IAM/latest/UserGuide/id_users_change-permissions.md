# Change permissions for an IAM user
<a name="id_users_change-permissions"></a>

You can change the permissions for an IAM user in your AWS account by changing its group memberships, by copying permissions from an existing user, by attaching policies directly to a user, or by setting a [permissions boundary](access_policies_boundaries.md). A permissions boundary controls the maximum permissions that a user can have. Permissions boundaries are an advanced AWS feature.

For information about the permissions that you need in order to modify the permissions for a user, see [Permissions required to access IAM resources](access_permissions-required.md).

## View user access
<a name="users-modify_prerequisites"></a>

Before you change the permissions for a user, you should review its recent service-level activity. This is important because you don't want to remove access from a principal (person or application) who is using it. For more information about viewing last accessed information, see [Refine permissions in AWS using last accessed information](access_policies_last-accessed.md).

## Generate a policy based on a user's access activity
<a name="users_change_permissions-gen-policy"></a>

You might sometimes grant permissions to an IAM entity (user or role) beyond what they require. To help you refine the permissions that you grant, you can generate an IAM policy that is based on the access activity for an entity. IAM Access Analyzer reviews your AWS CloudTrail logs and generates a policy template that contains the permissions that have been used by the entity in your specified date range. You can use the template to create a managed policy with fine-grained permissions and then attach it to the IAM entity. That way, you grant only the permissions that the user or role needs to interact with AWS resources for your specific use case. To learn more, see [IAM Access Analyzer policy generation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-policy-generation.html).

## Adding permissions to a user (console)
<a name="users_change_permissions-add-console"></a>

IAM offers three ways to add permissions policies to a user:
+ **Add the IAM user to an IAM group** – Make the user a member of a group. The policies from the group are attached to the user.
+ **Copy permissions from an existing IAM user** – Copy all group memberships, attached managed policies, inline policies, and any existing permissions boundaries from the source user.
+ **Attach policies directly to the IAM user** – Attach a managed policy directly to the user. For easier permissions management, attach your policies to a group and then make IAM users members of the appropriate groups.

**Important**  
If the user has a permissions boundary, then you cannot add more permissions to the user than are allowed by the permissions boundary.

### To add permissions by adding the IAM user to a group
<a name="users_change_permissions-add-group-console"></a>

Adding an IAM user to an IAM group updates the user's permissions with the permissions defined for the group immediately.

------
#### [ Console ]

1. Follow the sign-in procedure appropriate to your user type as described in the topic [How to sign in to AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/how-to-sign-in.html) in the *AWS Sign-In User Guide*.

1. On the **IAM Console Home** page, in the left navigation pane, enter your query in the **Search IAM** text box.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**.

1. In the **Users** list, choose the name of the IAM user. 

1. Select the **Groups** tab to display the list of groups that include the current user.

1. Choose **Add user to groups**. 

1. Select the checkbox for each group that you want the user to join. The list shows each group's name and the policies that the user receives if made a member of that group.

1. (Optional) You can choose **Create group** to define a new group. This is useful if you want to add the user to a group with different attached policies than the existing groups:

   1. In the new tab, for **User group name**, type a name for your new group.
**Note**  
The number and size of IAM resources in an AWS account are limited. For more information, see [IAM and AWS STS quotas](reference_iam-quotas.md). Group names can be a combination of up to 128 letters, digits, and these characters: plus (\+), equal (=), comma (,), period (.), at sign (@), and hyphen (-). Names must be unique within an account. They are not distinguished by case. For example, you cannot create two groups named *TESTGROUP* and *testgroup*.

   1. Select one or more checkboxes for the managed policies that you want to attach to the group. You can also create a new managed policy by choosing **Create policy**. If you do, return to this browser tab or window when the new policy is done; choose **Refresh**; and then choose the new policy to attach it to your group. For more information, see [Define custom IAM permissions with customer managed policies](access_policies_create.md).

   1. Choose **Create user group**.

   1. Return to the original tab, refresh your list of groups. Then select the checkbox for your new group.

1. Choose **Add user to group(s)**.

The console displays a status message informing you that the user has been added to the groups you specified.

## Changing permissions for a user (console)
<a name="users_change_permissions-change-console"></a>

IAM allows you to change the permissions that are associated with a user in the following ways:
+ **Edit a permissions policy** – Edit a user's inline policy, the inline policy of the user's group, or edit a managed policy that is attached to the user directly or from a group. If the user has a permissions boundary, then you cannot provide more permissions than are allowed by the policy that was used as the user's permissions boundary.
+ **Changing the permissions boundary** – Change the policy that is used as the permissions boundary for the user. This can expand or restrict the maximum permissions that a user can have. 

### Editing a permissions policy attached to a user
<a name="users_change_permissions-edit-policy-console"></a>

Changing permissions updates the user's access immediately.

------
#### [ Console ]

1. Follow the sign-in procedure appropriate to your user type as described in the topic [How to sign in to AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/how-to-sign-in.html) in the *AWS Sign-In User Guide*.

1. On the **IAM Console Home** page, in the left navigation pane, enter your query in the **Search IAM** text box.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**.

1. In the **Users** list, choose the name of the IAM user whose permissions boundary you want to change. 

1. Choose the **Permissions** tab. If necessary, open the **Permissions boundary** section.

1. Choose the name of the policy that you want to edit to view details about the policy. Choose the **Entities attached** tab to view other entities (IAM users, groups, and roles) that might be affected if you edit the policy. 

1. Choose the **Permissions** tab and review the permissions granted by the policy. To make changes to the permissions, choose **Edit**. 

1. Edit the policy and resolve any [policy validation](access_policies_policy-validator.md) recommendations. For more information, see [Edit IAM policies](access_policies_manage-edit.md).

1. Choose **Next**, review the policy summary, and then choose **Save changes**.

The console displays a status message informing you that the policy has been updated.

## To remove a permissions policy from a user (console)
<a name="users_change_permissions-remove-policy-console"></a>

Removing a permissions policy updates the user's access immediately.

------
#### [ Console ]

1. Follow the sign-in procedure appropriate to your user type as described in the topic [How to sign in to AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/how-to-sign-in.html) in the *AWS Sign-In User Guide*.

1. On the **IAM Console Home** page, in the left navigation pane, enter your query in the **Search IAM** text box.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Users**.

1. Choose the name of the user whose permissions policies you want to remove. 

1. Choose the **Permissions** tab. 

1. If you want to remove permissions by removing an existing policy, view the **Attached via** column to understand how the user is getting that policy before choosing **Remove** to remove the policy:
   + If the policy applies because of group membership, then choosing **Remove** removes the user from the group. Remember that you might have multiple policies attached to a single group. If you remove a user from a group, the user loses access to *all* policies that it received through that group membership.
   + If the policy is a managed policy attached directly to the user, then choosing **Remove** detaches the policy from the user. This does not affect the policy itself or any other entity that the policy might be attached to.
   + If the policy is an inline embedded policy, then choosing **Remove** removes the policy from IAM. Inline policies that are attached directly to a user exist only on that user.

If the policy was granted to the user through a group membership, the console displays a status message informing you that the IAM user was removed from the IAM group. If the policy directly attached or inline, the status message informs you that the policy has been removed.
