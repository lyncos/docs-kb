# Switch from a user to an IAM role (console)
<a name="id_roles_use_switch-role-console"></a>

You can switch roles when you sign in as an IAM user, a user in IAM Identity Center, a SAML-federated role, or a web-identity federated role. A *role* specifies a set of permissions that you can use to access AWS resources that you need. However, you don't sign in to a role, but once signed in as an IAM user you can switch to an IAM role. This temporarily sets aside your original user permissions and instead gives you the permissions assigned to the role. The role can be in your own account or any other AWS account. For more information about roles, their benefits, and how to create them, see [IAM roles](id_roles.md), and [IAM role creation](id_roles_create.md).

The permissions of your user and any roles that you switch to aren't cumulative. Only one set of permissions is active at a time. When you switch to a role, you temporarily give up your user permissions and work with the permissions that are assigned to the role. When you exit the role, your user permissions are automatically restored.

When you switch roles in the AWS Management Console, the console always uses your original credentials to authorize the switch. For example, if you switch to RoleA, IAM uses your original credentials to determine whether you are allowed to assume RoleA. If you then switch to RoleB *while you are using RoleA*, AWS still uses your **original** credentials to authorize the switch, not the credentials for RoleA.

**Note**  
When you sign in as a user in IAM Identity Center, as a SAML-federated role, or as a web-identity federated role you assume an IAM role when you start your session. For example, when a user in IAM Identity Center signs in to the AWS access portal they can choose a permission set or access a role assigned through [account access manager](account-access-manager.md) before they can access AWS resources.

## Role sessions
<a name="id_roles_iam_user-switch-role-sessions"></a>

When you switch roles, your AWS Management Console session lasts for 1 hour by default. IAM user sessions are 12 hours by default, other users might have different session durations defined. When you switch roles in the console, you are granted the role maximum session duration, or the remaining time in your user session, whichever is less. You can't extend your session duration by assuming a role.

For example, assume that a maximum session duration of 10 hours is set for a role. You have been signed in to the console for 8 hours when you decide to switch to the role. There are 4 hours remaining in your user session, so the allowed role session duration is 4 hours, not the maximum session duration of 10 hours. The following table shows how to determine the session duration for an IAM user when switching roles in the console.


| IAM user session time remaining is… | Role session duration is… | 
| --- | --- | 
| Less than role maximum session duration | Time remaining in user session | 
| Greater than role maximum session duration | Maximum session duration value | 
| Equal to role maximum session duration | Maximum session duration value (approximate) | 

Using the credentials from one role to assume a different role is called [role chaining](id_roles.md#iam-term-role-chaining). When you use role chaining, the session duration is limited to one hour, regardless of the maximum session duration setting configured for individual roles. This applies to AWS Management Console role switching, AWS CLI, and API operations.

**Note**  
Some AWS service consoles can autorenew your role session when it expires without you taking any action. Some might prompt you to reload your browser page to reauthenticate your session.

## Considerations
<a name="id_roles_iam_user-switch-role-considerations"></a>
+ You can't switch roles if you sign in as the AWS account root user. 
+ Users must be granted permission to switch roles by policy. For instructions, see [Grant a user permissions to switch roles](id_roles_use_permissions-to-switch.md).
+ You can't switch roles in the AWS Management Console to a role that requires an [ExternalId](id_roles_common-scenarios_third-party.md#id_roles_third-party_external-id) value. You can switch to such a role only by calling the [`AssumeRole`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) API that supports the `ExternalId` parameter.

## To switch to a role
<a name="id_roles_iam_user-switch-role-console-procedure"></a>

1. Follow the sign-in procedure appropriate to you user type as described in [Sign in to the AWS Management Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/how-to-sign-in.html) in the *AWS Sign-In User Guide*.

1. In the AWS Management Console, choose your user name on the navigation bar in the upper right. It typically looks like this: **{{username}}@{{account\_ID\_number\_or\_alias}}**.

1. Select one of the following methods to switch roles:
   + Choose **Switch role**.
   + If you have opted in to multi-session support, choose **Add session** and select **Switch role**.
**Note**  
You can sign in to up to five different identities simultaneously in a single web browser in the AWS Management Console. For details, see [Signing in to multiple accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsconsolehelpdocs/latest/gsg/multisession.html) in the *AWS Management Console Getting Started Guide*.

1. On the **Switch Role** page, type the account ID number or the account alias and the name of the role that was provided by your administrator.
**Note**  
If your administrator created the role with a path, such as `division_abc/subdivision_efg/roleToDoX`, then you must type that complete path and name in the **Role** box. If you type only the role name, or if the combined `Path` and `RoleName` exceed 64 characters, the role switch fails. This is a limit of the browser cookies that store the role name. If this happens, contact your administrator and ask them to reduce the size of the path and role name.

1. (Optional)You can enter a display name and select a display color that will highlight the role in the console navigation bar.
   + For **Display name**, type text that you want to appear on the navigation bar in place of your user name when this role is active. A name is suggested, based on the account and role information, but you can change it to whatever has meaning for you. 
   + For **Display color**, select a color to highlight the display name.

   The name and color can help remind you when this role is active, which changes your permissions. For example, for a role that gives you access to the test environment, you might specify a **Display name** of **Test** and select the green **Color**. For the role that gives you access to production, you might specify a **Display name** of **Production** and select red as the **Color**.

1. Choose **Switch Role**. The display name and color replace your user name on the navigation bar, and you can start using the permissions that the role grants you.

1. After you have completed the tasks that require the IAM role you can switch back to your original session. This will remove the additional permissions provided by the role and return you to your standard permissions.

   1. In the IAM console, choose your role's **Display name** on the navigation bar in the upper right.

   1. Choose **Switch back**.

      For example, assume you are signed in to account number `123456789012` using the user name `Richard`. After you use the `admin-role` role, you want to stop using the role and return to your original permissions. To stop using the role, you choose **admin-role @ 123456789012**, and then choose **Switch back**.

**Tip**  
The last several roles that you used appear on the menu. The next time you want to switch to one of those roles, you can simply choose the role you want. You are only required to type the account and role information manually if the role isn't displayed on the menu.
