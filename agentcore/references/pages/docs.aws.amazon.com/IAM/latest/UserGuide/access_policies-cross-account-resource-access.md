# Cross account resource access in IAM
<a name="access_policies-cross-account-resource-access"></a>

For some AWS services, you can grant cross-account access to your resources using IAM. To do this, you can attach a resource policy directly to the resource that you want to share, or use a role as a proxy.

To share the resource directly, the resource that you want to share must support [resource-based policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction_access-management.html#intro-access-resource-based-policies). Unlike an identity-based policy for a role, a resource-based policy specifies who (which principal) can access that resource.

Use a role as a proxy when you want to access resources in another account that do not support resource-based policies.

For details about the differences between these policy types, see [Identity-based policies and resource-based policies](access_policies_identity-vs-resource.md).

**Note**  
IAM roles and resource-based policies delegate access across accounts only within a single partition. For example, you have an account in US West (N. California) in the standard `aws` partition. You also have an account in China in the `aws-cn` partition. You can't use a resource-based policy in your account in China to allow access for users in your standard AWS account.

## Cross-account access using roles
<a name="access_policies-cross-account-using-roles"></a>

Not all AWS services support resource-based policies. For these services, you can use cross-account IAM roles to centralize permission management when providing cross-account access to multiple services. A cross-account IAM role is an IAM role that includes a [trust policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html#term_trust-policy) that allows IAM principals in another AWS account to assume the role. Put simply, you can create a role in one AWS account that delegates specific permissions to another AWS account.

For information about attaching a policy to an IAM identity, see [Manage IAM policies](access_policies_manage.md).

**Note**  
When a principal switches to a role to temporarily use the permissions of the role, they give up their original permissions and take on the permissions assigned to the role they’ve assumed.

Let’s take a look at the overall process as it applies to APN Partner software that needs to access a customer account.

1. The customer creates an IAM role in their own account with a policy that allows access the Amazon S3 resources that the APN partner requires. In this example, the role name is `APNPartner`.

------
#### [ JSON ]

****  

   ```
   {
       "Version":"2012-10-17",		 	 	 
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "s3:*",
               "Resource": [
                   "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name"
               ]
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

------

1. Then, the customer specifies that the role can be assumed by the partner’s AWS account by providing the APN Partner’s AWS account ID in the [trust policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-custom.html) for the `APNPartner` role.

#### [ JSON ]

****  

   ```
   {
       "Version":"2012-10-17",		 	 	 
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": {
                   "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::{{111122223333}}:role/{{APN-user-name}}"
               },
               "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

------

1. The customer gives the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to the APN partner. The ARN is the fully qualified name of the role.

   ```
   arn:aws:iam::{{Customer-Account-ID}}:role/{{APNPartner}}
   ```
**Note**  
We recommend using an external ID in multi-tenant situations. For details, see [Access to AWS accounts owned by third parties](id_roles_common-scenarios_third-party.md).

1. When the APN Partner’s software needs to access the customer’s account, the software calls the [AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) API in the AWS Security Token Service with the ARN of the role in the customer’s account. STS returns a temporary AWS credential that allows the software to do its work.

For another example of granting cross-account access using roles, see [Access for an IAM user in another AWS account that you own](id_roles_common-scenarios_aws-accounts.md). You can also follow the [IAM tutorial: Delegate access across AWS accounts using IAM roles](tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.md).

## Cross-account access using resource-based policies
<a name="access_policies-cross-account-using-resource-based-policies"></a>

When an account accesses a resource through another account using a resource-based policy, the principal still works in the trusted account and does not have to give up their permissions to receive the role permissions. In other words, the principal continues to have access to resources in the trusted account while having access to the resource in the trusting account. This is useful for tasks such as copying information to or from the shared resource in the other account.

The principals that you can specify in a resource based policy include accounts, IAM users, AWS STS federated user principals, SAML federated principals, OIDC federated principals, IAM roles, assumed-role sessions, or AWS services. For more information, see [Specifying a principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html#Principal_specifying).

To learn whether principals in accounts outside of your zone of trust (trusted organization or account) have access to assume your roles, see [Identifying resources shared with an external entity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html#what-is-access-analyzer-resource-identification).

The following list includes some of the AWS services that support resource-based policies. For a complete list of the growing number of AWS services that support attaching permission policies to resources instead of principals, see [AWS services that work with IAM](reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.md) and look for the services that have **Yes** in the **Resource Based** column.
+ **Amazon S3 buckets** — The policy is attached to the bucket, but the policy controls access to both the bucket and the objects in it. For more information, see [Bucket policies for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-policies.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide*. In some cases, it may be best to use roles for cross-account access to Amazon S3. For more information, see the [example walkthroughs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-walkthroughs-managing-access.html) in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service User Guide*.
+ **Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics** — For more information, see [Example cases for Amazon SNS access control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-access-policy-use-cases.html) in the *Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide*.
+ **Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues** – For more information, see [Appendix: The Access Policy Language](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-creating-custom-policies.html) in the *Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide*. 

## Resource-based policies to delegate AWS permissions
<a name="access_policies-cross-account-delegating-resource-based-policies"></a>

If a resource grants permissions to principals in your account, you can then delegate those permissions to specific IAM identities. Identities are users, groups of users, or roles in your account. You delegate permissions by attaching a policy to the identity. You can grant up to the maximum permissions that are allowed by the resource-owning account.

**Important**  
In cross account access, a principal needs an `Allow` in the identity policy **and** the resource-based policy.

Assume that a resource-based policy allows all principals in your account full administrative access to a resource. Then you can delegate full access, read-only access, or any other partial access to principals in your AWS account. Alternatively, if the resource-based policy allows only list permissions, then you can delegate only list access. If you try to delegate more permissions than your account has, your principals will still have only list access.

For more information about how these decisions are made, see [Determining whether a request is allowed or denied within an account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic_policy-eval-denyallow.html).

**Note**  
IAM roles and resource-based policies delegate access across accounts only within a single partition. For example, you can't add cross-account access between an account in the standard `aws` partition and an account in the `aws-cn` partition. 

For example, assume that you manage `AccountA` and `AccountB`. In AccountA, you have an Amazon S3 bucket named `BucketA`.

![A resource-based policy created for Amazon S3 bucket provides AccountB permissions to AccountA.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/images/access_policies-cross-account.png)


1. You attach a resource-based policy to `BucketA` that allows all principals in AccountB full access to objects in your bucket. They can create, read, or delete any objects in that bucket. 

------
#### [ JSON ]

****  

   ```
   {
       "Version":"2012-10-17",		 	 	 
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "PrincipalAccess",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": {
                   "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::{{111122223333}}:root"
               },
               "Action": "s3:*",
               "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::BucketA/*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

------

   AccountA gives AccountB full access to BucketA by naming AccountB as a principal in the resource-based policy. As a result, AccountB is authorized to perform any action on BucketA, and the AccountB administrator can delegate access to its users in AccountB.

   The AccountB root user has all of the permissions that are granted to the account. Therefore, the root user has full access to BucketA.

1. In AccountB, attach a policy to the IAM user named User2. That policy allows the user read-only access to the objects in BucketA. That means that User2 can view the objects, but not create, edit, or delete them. 

------
#### [ JSON ]

****  

   ```
   {
       "Version":"2012-10-17",		 	 	 
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect" : "Allow", 
               "Action" : [ 
                   "s3:Get*", 
                   "s3:List*" ], 
                   "Resource" : "arn:aws:s3:::BucketA/*" 
           } 
       ]
   }
   ```

------

   The maximum level of access that AccountB can delegate is the access level that is granted to the account. In this case, the resource-based policy granted full access to AccountB, but User2 is granted only read-only access.

   The AccountB administrator does not give access to User1. By default, users do not have any permissions except those that are explicitly granted, so User1 does not have access to BucketA.

IAM evaluates a principal's permissions at the time the principal makes a request. If you use wildcards (\*) to give users full access to your resources, principals can access any resources that your AWS account has access to. This is true even for resources you add or gain access to after creating the user's policy.

In the preceding example, if AccountB had attached a policy to User2 that allowed full access to all resources in all accounts, User2 would automatically have access to any resources that AccountB has access to. This includes the BucketA access and access to any other resources granted by resource-based policies in AccountA.

For more information about complex uses of roles, such as granting access to applications and services, see [Common scenarios for IAM roles](id_roles_common-scenarios.md).

**Important**  
Give access only to entities you trust, and give the minimum level of access necessary. Whenever the trusted entity is another AWS account, any IAM principal can be granted access to your resource. The trusted AWS account can delegate access only to the extent that it has been granted access; it cannot delegate more access than the account itself has been granted.

For information about permissions, policies, and the permission policy language that you use to write policies, see [Access management for AWS resources](access.md).
