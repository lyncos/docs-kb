# Choose between managed policies and inline policies
<a name="access_policies-choosing-managed-or-inline"></a>

Consider your use cases when deciding between managed and inline policies. In most cases, we recommend that you use managed policies instead of inline policies.

**Note**  
You can use both managed and inline policies together to define common and unique permissions for a principal entity.

Managed policies provide the following features:

**Reusability**  
A single managed policy can be attached to multiple principal entities (users, groups, and roles). You can create a library of policies that define useful permissions for your AWS account, and then attach these policies to principal entities as needed.

**Central change management**  
When you change a managed policy, the change is applied to all principal entities that the policy is attached to. For example, if you want to add permission for a new AWS API, you can update a customer managed policy or associate an AWS managed policy to add the permission. If you're using an AWS managed policy, AWS updates the policy. When a managed policy is updated, the changes are applied to all principal entities that the managed policy is attached to. In contrast, to change an inline policy, you must individually edit each identity that contains the inline policy. For example, if a group and a role both contain the same inline policy, you must individually edit both principal entities to change that policy. 

**Versioning and rolling back**  
When you change a customer managed policy, the changed policy doesn't overwrite the existing policy. Instead, IAM creates a new version of the managed policy. IAM stores up to five versions of your customer managed policies. You can use policy versions to revert a policy to an earlier version as needed.   
A policy version is different from a `Version` policy element. The `Version` policy element is used within a policy and defines the version of the policy language. To learn more about policy versions, see [Versioning IAM policies](access_policies_managed-versioning.md). To learn more about the `Version` policy element see [IAM JSON policy elements: Version](reference_policies_elements_version.md).

**Delegating permissions management**  
You can allow users in your AWS account to attach and detach policies while maintaining control over the permissions defined in those policies. To do this, designate some users as full administrators—that is, administrators that can create, update, and delete policies. You can then designate other users as limited administrators. Those limited administrators can attach policies to other principal entities, but only the policies that you have allowed them to attach.  
For more information about delegating permissions management, see [Controlling access to policies](access_controlling.md#access_controlling-policies). 

**Larger policy character limits**  
The maximum character size limit for managed policies is greater than the character limit for group inline policies. If you reach the inline policy's character size limit, you can create more IAM groups and attach the managed policy to the group.  
For more information on quotas and limits, see [IAM and AWS STS quotas](reference_iam-quotas.md). 

**Automatic updates for AWS managed policies**  
AWS maintains AWS managed policies and updates them when necessary, for example, to add permissions for new AWS services, without you having to make changes. The updates are automatically applied to the principal entities that you have attached the AWS managed policy to. 

## Get started with managed policies
<a name="access_policies-get-started-managed-policy"></a>

We recommend using policies that [grant least privilege](access_policies.md#grant-least-priv), or granting only the permissions required to perform a task. The most secure way to grant least privilege is to write a customer managed policy with only the permissions needed by your team. You must create a process to allow your team to request more permissions when necessary. It takes time and expertise to [create IAM customer managed policies](access_policies_create-console.md) that provide your team with only the permissions they need.

To get started adding permissions to your IAM identities (users, groups of users, and roles), you can use [AWS managed policies](access_policies_managed-vs-inline.md#aws-managed-policies). AWS managed policies don't grant least privilege permissions. You must consider the security risk of granting your principals more permissions than they need to do their job.

You can attach AWS managed policies, including job functions, to any IAM identity. For more information, see [Adding and removing IAM identity permissions](access_policies_manage-attach-detach.md).

To switch to least privilege permissions, you can run AWS Identity and Access Management and Access Analyzer to monitor the principals with AWS managed policies. After learning which permissions they are using, then you can write or generate a customer managed policy with only the required permissions for your team. This is less secure, but provides more flexibility as you learn how your team is using AWS. For more information, see [IAM Access Analyzer policy generation](access-analyzer-policy-generation.md).

AWS managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases. For more information about AWS managed policies that are designed for specific job functions, see [AWS managed policies for job functions](access_policies_job-functions.md).

For a list of AWS managed policies, see [AWS Managed Policy Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/about-managed-policy-reference.html).

## Using inline policies
<a name="policies-using-inline-policies"></a>

Inline policies are useful if you want to maintain a strict one-to-one relationship between a policy and the identity to which it is applied. For example, if you want to be sure that the permissions in a policy are not inadvertently assigned to an identity other than the one they're intended for. When you use an inline policy, the permissions in the policy cannot be inadvertently attached to the wrong identity. In addition, when you use the AWS Management Console to delete that identity, the policies embedded in the identity are deleted as well because they are part of the principal entity.
