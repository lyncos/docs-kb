# Tutorial: Create a Firehose stream from console
<a name="basic-create"></a>

You can use the AWS Management Console or an AWS SDK to create a Firehose stream to your chosen destination. 

You can update the configuration of your Firehose stream at any time after it’s created, using the Amazon Data Firehose console or [UpdateDestination](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateDestination.html). Your Firehose stream remains in the `Active` state while your configuration is updated, and you can continue to send data. The updated configuration normally takes effect within a few minutes. The version number of a Firehose stream is increased by a value of `1` after you update the configuration. It is reflected in the delivered Amazon S3 object name. For more information, see [Configure Amazon S3 object name format](s3-object-name.md).

Perform the steps in the following topics to create a Firehose stream.

**Topics**
+ [Choose source and destination for your Firehose stream](create-name.md)
+ [Configure source settings](configure-source.md)
+ [(Optional) Configure record transformation and format conversion](create-transform.md)
+ [Configure destination settings](create-destination.md)
+ [Configure backup settings](create-configure-backup.md)
+ [Configure advanced settings](create-configure-advanced.md)
