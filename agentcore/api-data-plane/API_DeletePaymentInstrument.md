For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](CommonErrors.md).

 ** AccessDeniedException **   
The exception that occurs when you do not have sufficient permissions to perform an action. Verify that your IAM policy includes the necessary permissions for the operation you are trying to perform.  
HTTP Status Code: 403

The exception that occurs when the service encounters an unexpected internal error. This is a temporary condition that will resolve itself with retries. We recommend implementing exponential backoff retry logic in your application.  
HTTP Status Code: 500

The exception that occurs when the specified resource does not exist. This can happen when using an invalid identifier or when trying to access a resource that has been deleted.  
HTTP Status Code: 404

 ** ThrottlingException **   
The exception that occurs when the request was denied due to request throttling. This happens when you exceed the allowed request rate for an operation. Reduce the frequency of requests or implement exponential backoff retry logic in your application.  
HTTP Status Code: 429

 ** ValidationException **   
The exception that occurs when the input fails to satisfy the constraints specified by the service. Check the error message for details about which input parameter is invalid and correct your request.
