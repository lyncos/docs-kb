For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](CommonErrors.md).

The exception that occurs when you do not have sufficient permissions to perform an action. Verify that your IAM policy includes the necessary permissions for the operation you are trying to perform.  
HTTP Status Code: 403

HTTP Status Code: 409

The exception that occurs when the request was denied due to request throttling. This happens when you exceed the allowed request rate for an operation. Reduce the frequency of requests or implement exponential backoff retry logic in your application.

This exception is thrown when the JWT bearer token is invalid or not found for OAuth bearer token based access  
HTTP Status Code: 401
