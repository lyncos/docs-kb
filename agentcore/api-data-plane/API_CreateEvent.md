## Errors
<a name="API_CreateEvent_Errors"></a>

For information about the errors that are common to all actions, see [Common Error Types](CommonErrors.md).

 ** AccessDeniedException **   
The exception that occurs when you do not have sufficient permissions to perform an action. Verify that your IAM policy includes the necessary permissions for the operation you are trying to perform.  
HTTP Status Code: 403

The input fails to satisfy the constraints specified by AgentCore. Check your input values and try again.  
HTTP Status Code: 400

 ** ResourceNotFoundException **   
The exception that occurs when the specified resource does not exist. This can happen when using an invalid identifier or when trying to access a resource that has been deleted.  
HTTP Status Code: 404

 ** RetryableConflictException **   
The exception that occurs when there is a retryable conflict performing an operation. This is a temporary condition that may resolve itself with retries. We recommend implementing exponential backoff retry logic in your application.

The request was denied due to request throttling. Reduce the frequency of requests and try again.  
HTTP Status Code: 429
