# Finding
<a name="API_Finding"></a>

Represents a finding or issue discovered during policy generation or validation. Findings provide insights about potential problems, recommendations, or validation results from policy analysis operations. Finding types include: VALID (policy is ready to use), INVALID (policy has validation errors that must be fixed), NOT\_TRANSLATABLE (input couldn't be converted to policy), ALLOW\_ALL (policy would allow all actions, potential security risk), ALLOW\_NONE (policy would allow no actions, unusable), DENY\_ALL (policy would deny all actions, may be too restrictive), and DENY\_NONE (policy would deny no actions, ineffective). Review all findings before creating policies from generated assets to ensure they match your security requirements.
