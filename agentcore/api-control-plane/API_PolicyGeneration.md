# PolicyGeneration
<a name="API_PolicyGeneration"></a>

Represents a policy generation request within the AgentCore Policy system. Tracks the AI-powered conversion of natural language descriptions into Dogwood policy statements, enabling users to author policies by describing authorization requirements in plain English. The generation process analyzes the natural language input along with the Gateway's tool context and Cedar schema to produce one or more validated policy options. Each generation request tracks the status of the conversion process and maintains findings about the generated policies, including validation results and potential issues. Generated policy assets remain available for one week after successful generation, allowing time to review and create policies from the generated options.
