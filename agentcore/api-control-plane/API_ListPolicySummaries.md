# ListPolicySummaries
<a name="API_ListPolicySummaries"></a>

Retrieves a paginated list of metadata-only policy summaries within a policy engine without decrypting customer content. This lightweight read operation returns resource identifiers, status, and timestamps for each policy, but does not include policy definitions, descriptions, or status reasons. Because this operation does not require access to the customer's AWS KMS key, it is suitable for resource discovery, inventory, and integration scenarios where only metadata is needed.
