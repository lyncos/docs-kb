# CreatePolicyEngine
<a name="API_CreatePolicyEngine"></a>

Creates a new policy engine within the AgentCore Policy system. A policy engine is a collection of policies that evaluates and authorizes agent tool calls. When associated with Gateways (each Gateway can be associated with at most one policy engine, but multiple Gateways can be associated with the same engine), the policy engine intercepts all agent requests and determines whether to allow or deny each action based on the defined policies. This is an asynchronous operation. Use the [GetPolicyEngine](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore-control/latest/APIReference/API_GetPolicyEngine.html) operation to poll the `status` field to track completion.

## Request Syntax
<a name="API_CreatePolicyEngine_RequestSyntax"></a>

```
POST /policy-engines HTTP/1.1
Content-type: application/json

{
   "clientToken": "{{string}}",
   "description": "{{string}}",
   "encryptionKeyArn": "{{string}}",
   "name": "{{string}}",
   "tags": { 
      "{{string}}" : "{{string}}" 
   }
}
```

## URI Request Parameters
<a name="API_CreatePolicyEngine_RequestParameters"></a>

The request does not use any URI parameters.

## Request Body
<a name="API_CreatePolicyEngine_RequestBody"></a>

The request accepts the following data in JSON format.

 ** [clientToken](#API_CreatePolicyEngine_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="bedrockagentcorecontrol-CreatePolicyEngine-request-clientToken"></a>
A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. If you retry a request with the same client token, the service returns the same response without creating a duplicate policy engine.  
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 33. Maximum length of 256.  
Pattern: `[a-zA-Z0-9](-*[a-zA-Z0-9]){0,256}`   
Required: No

 ** [description](#API_CreatePolicyEngine_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="bedrockagentcorecontrol-CreatePolicyEngine-request-description"></a>
A human-readable description of the policy engine's purpose and scope (1-4,096 characters). This helps administrators understand the policy engine's role in the overall governance strategy. Document which Gateway this engine will be associated with, what types of tools or workflows it governs, and the team or service responsible for maintaining it. Clear descriptions are essential when managing multiple policy engines across different services or environments.  
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 4096.  
Required: No

 ** [encryptionKeyArn](#API_CreatePolicyEngine_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="bedrockagentcorecontrol-CreatePolicyEngine-request-encryptionKeyArn"></a>
The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS KMS key used to encrypt the policy engine data.  
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 2048.  
Pattern: `arn:aws(|-cn|-us-gov):kms:[a-zA-Z0-9-]*:[0-9]{12}:key/[a-zA-Z0-9-]{36}`   
Required: No

 ** [name](#API_CreatePolicyEngine_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="bedrockagentcorecontrol-CreatePolicyEngine-request-name"></a>
The customer-assigned immutable name for the policy engine. This name identifies the policy engine and cannot be changed after creation.  
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 48.  
Pattern: `[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*`   
Required: Yes

 ** [tags](#API_CreatePolicyEngine_RequestSyntax) **   <a name="bedrockagentcorecontrol-CreatePolicyEngine-request-tags"></a>
A map of tag keys and values to assign to an AgentCore Policy. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment.  
Type: String to string map  
Map Entries: Minimum number of 0 items. Maximum number of 50 items.  
Key Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1. Maximum length of 128.  
Key Pattern: `[a-zA-Z0-9\s._:/=+@-]*`   
Value Length Constraints: Minimum length of 0. Maximum length of 256.
