# Policy
<a name="API_Policy"></a>

Represents a complete policy resource within the AgentCore Policy system. Policies are ARN-able resources that contain Cedar or Dogwood policy statements and associated metadata for controlling agent behavior and access decisions. Each policy belongs to a policy engine and defines fine-grained authorization rules that are evaluated in real-time as agents interact with tools through Gateway. Policies use Cedar or Dogwood to specify who (principals based on OAuth claims like username, role, or scope) can perform what actions (tool calls) on which resources (Gateways), with optional conditions for attribute-based access control. Multiple policies can apply to a single request, with forbid-wins semantics ensuring that security restrictions are never accidentally overridden.
