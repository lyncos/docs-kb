# Delete a consent portal
<a name="identity-delete-consent-portal"></a>

When you no longer need a consent portal, you can delete it from the AgentCore console or with the AWS CLI. Deleting a consent portal permanently removes it: its consent portal URL no longer serves end users, and any agent flows that depend on it can no longer obtain user consent through the portal. When you delete a consent portal, it transitions to the `DELETING` status and is then permanently removed.

Delete a consent portal with the `delete-consent-portal` command. Identify the consent portal with the required `--consent-portal-identifier` parameter, which accepts either the consent portal ID or its full ARN.

The following command deletes a consent portal. Replace {{<consent-portal-id>}} with your value.

```
aws bedrock-agentcore-control delete-consent-portal \
    --consent-portal-identifier "<consent-portal-id>"
```
