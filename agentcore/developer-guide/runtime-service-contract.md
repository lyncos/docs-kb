# Understand the AgentCore Runtime service contract
<a name="runtime-service-contract"></a>

The AgentCore Runtime service contract defines the standardized communication protocol that your agent application must implement to integrate with the Amazon Bedrock agent hosting infrastructure. This contract ensures seamless communication between your custom agent code and AWS's managed hosting environment.

## Supported protocols
<a name="supported-protocols"></a>

The AgentCore Runtime service contract supports the following communication protocols:
+  [HTTP](runtime-http-protocol-contract.md) : Direct REST API endpoints for traditional request/response patterns
+  [MCP](runtime-mcp-protocol-contract.md) : Model Context Protocol for tools and agent servers
+  [A2A](runtime-a2a-protocol-contract.md) : Agent-to-Agent protocol for multi-agent communication and discovery
+  [AG-UI](runtime-agui-protocol-contract.md) : Agent-to-User Interface protocol for interactive agent experiences with UI rendering
