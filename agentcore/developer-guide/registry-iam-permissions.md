# IAM Permissions
<a name="registry-iam-permissions"></a>

**Migration Now Open**  
 AWS Agent Registry has launched under the new `agent-registry` namespace. Support for the public preview `bedrock-agentcore` namespace will be discontinued on October 30, 2026. For migration instructions, see [Comprehensive registry migration guide](registry-faq.md).

## Registry actions
<a name="registry-iam-actions"></a>

To create, manage, or use registries, attach an identity-based policy to your IAM identity that allows it to perform [AWS Agent Registry-related actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonagentregistry.html). For comprehensive permissions, you can use the [AgentRegistryFullAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AgentRegistryFullAccess.html) managed policy.

For greater security and control, you can create your own custom policy by reducing the permissions in the full access policy.

**Note**  
In the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace, the actions listed below are covered by the `BedrockAgentCoreFullAccess` managed policy. In the `agent-registry` namespace, they are covered by the new `AgentRegistryFullAccess` managed policy. Each table below shows both namespaces during the migration window. For the complete migration mapping, see [Comprehensive registry migration guide](registry-faq.md).

## Registry record control plane actions
<a name="registry-iam-record-control-plane"></a>

**Example**  


| Action | Description | Access level | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  `agent-registry:CreateRegistryRecord`  | Grants permission to create a registry record | Write | 
|  `agent-registry:GetRegistryRecord`  | Grants permission to get a registry record | Read | 
|  `agent-registry:UpdateRegistryRecord`  | Grants permission to update a registry record | Write | 
|  `agent-registry:DeleteRegistryRecord`  | Grants permission to delete a registry record | Write | 
|  `agent-registry:ListRegistryRecords`  | Grants permission to list registry records | List |

|  `bedrock-agentcore:GetRegistryRecord`  | Grants permission to get a registry record | Read | 
|  `bedrock-agentcore:UpdateRegistryRecord`  | Grants permission to update a registry record | Write | 
|  `bedrock-agentcore:DeleteRegistryRecord`  | Grants permission to delete a registry record | Write | 
|  `bedrock-agentcore:ListRegistryRecords`  | Grants permission to list registry records | List | 
|  `bedrock-agentcore:SubmitRegistryRecordForApproval`  | Grants permission to submit a registry record for approval | Write | 
|  `bedrock-agentcore:UpdateRegistryRecordStatus`  | Grants permission to approve, reject, or deprecate a registry record | Write | 

## Registry data plane actions
<a name="registry-iam-data-plane"></a>

**Example**  


| Action | Description | Access level | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  `agent-registry:SearchDiscoverableRegistryRecords`  | Grants permission to search approved registry records | Read | 
|  `agent-registry:ListDiscoverableRegistryRecords`  | Grants permission to list approved registry records | List | 
|  `agent-registry:GetDiscoverableRegistryRecord`  | Grants permission to retrieve an approved registry record. Also authorizes `BatchGetDiscoverableRegistryRecord`. | Read | 
|  `agent-registry:InvokeRegistryMcp`  | Grants permission to invoke the registry MCP endpoint | Read | 


| Action | Description | Access level | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  `bedrock-agentcore:SearchRegistryRecords`  | Grants permission to search registry records | Read | 
|  `bedrock-agentcore:InvokeRegistryMcp`  | Grants permission to invoke the registry MCP endpoint | Read | 

**Note**  
For invoking the registry MCP endpoint, you need both the search action and the `InvokeRegistryMcp` action. In the `agent-registry` namespace, the search action is `agent-registry:SearchDiscoverableRegistryRecords`; in the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace it is `bedrock-agentcore:SearchRegistryRecords`.

**Note**  
 `BatchGetDiscoverableRegistryRecord` does not have its own IAM action. Each requested record is authorized against `agent-registry:GetDiscoverableRegistryRecord`. Grant `GetDiscoverableRegistryRecord` to use `BatchGetDiscoverableRegistryRecord`.

## Workload identity actions (required for registry lifecycle)
<a name="registry-iam-workload-identity"></a>

The following actions are required for registry-managed workload identity operations. These actions use the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace and are called by the service on your behalf during `CreateRegistry` and `DeleteRegistry` workflows.


| Action | Description | Access level | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  `bedrock-agentcore:CreateWorkloadIdentity`  | Grants permission to create a workload identity for a registry | Write | 
|  `bedrock-agentcore:GetWorkloadIdentity`  | Grants permission to retrieve workload identity details (used for idempotency on retry) | Read | 
|  `bedrock-agentcore:DeleteWorkloadIdentity`  | Grants permission to delete a workload identity when a registry is deleted | Write | 

**Note**  
The `GetWorkloadIdentity` permission is required to support idempotent retries of the `CreateRegistry` workflow. Without this permission, if a registry creation is retried (for example, after a transient failure), the workflow cannot verify the existing workload identity and will fail.

## IAM service-linked role actions (required for registry lifecycle)
<a name="registry-iam-create-service-linked-role"></a>

The following action is required during registry lifecycle management. This action uses the `iam` namespace and is called by the service on your behalf during the `CreateRegistry` workflow.


| Action | Description | Access level | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  `iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole`  | Grants permission to create the service-linked role for AWS Agent Registry | Write | 

**Note**  
The `CreateServiceLinkedRole` permission is required during registry creation to enable service to publish CloudWatch metrics in your account after the registry is created. Without this permission, registry creation will fail.

## Registry resource types
<a name="registry-iam-resource-types"></a>

The following resource types are defined for AWS Agent Registry:

**Example**  


| Resource type | ARN format | 
| --- | --- | 
| Registry |  `arn:aws:agent-registry:{region}:{account}:registry/{registryId}`  | 
| Registry record |  `arn:aws:agent-registry:{region}:{account}:registry/{registryId}/record/{recordId}`  | 


| Resource type | ARN format | 
| --- | --- | 
| Registry |  `arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:{region}:{account}:registry/{registryId}`  | 
| Registry record |  `arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:{region}:{account}:registry/{registryId}/record/{recordId}`  |
