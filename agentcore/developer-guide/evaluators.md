# Evaluators
<a name="evaluators"></a>

Evaluators are the core components that assess your agent’s performance across different dimensions. They analyze agent traces and provide quantitative scores based on specific criteria such as helpfulness, accuracy, or custom business metrics. AgentCore Evaluations offers built-in evaluators for common use cases and third-party evaluators from open source evaluation libraries. You can also create custom evaluators tailored to your specific requirements.

## Built-in evaluators
<a name="built-in-evaluators"></a>

Built-in evaluators are pre-configured solutions that use Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges to evaluate agent performance. These evaluators come with predefined configurations, including carefully crafted prompt templates, selected evaluator models, and standardized scoring criteria.

Built-in evaluators are designed to address common evaluation needs while ensuring consistency and reliability across assessments. Because they are part of our fully managed offering, you can use them immediately without any additional configuration, and we will continue improving their quality and adding new evaluators over time. To preserve consistency and reliability, the configurations of built-in evaluators cannot be modified.

## Third-party evaluators

Third-party evaluators come from the DeepEval and AutoEval open source libraries. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore manages them the same way as built-in evaluators. Select a third-party evaluator by ID and the service runs it—no model or configuration required. You can also derive a custom evaluator from a built-in or third-party evaluator to run its logic on your own model. For more information, see [Third-party evaluators](third-party-evaluators.md).

## Custom evaluators

Custom evaluators offer more flexibility by allowing you to define all aspects of your evaluation process. AgentCore Evaluations supports the following types of custom evaluators:
+  **LLM-as-a-judge evaluators** – Define your own evaluator model, evaluation instructions, and scoring schemas. You can tailor the evaluation to your specific needs by selecting the evaluator model, crafting custom evaluation instructions, defining specific evaluation criteria, and designing your own scoring schema. For more information, see [Custom evaluators](custom-evaluators.md).
+  **Code-based evaluators** – Use your own AWS Lambda function to programmatically evaluate agent performance. This approach gives you full control over the evaluation logic, enabling deterministic checks, external API calls, regex matching, custom metrics, or any business-specific rules without relying on an LLM judge. For more information, see [Custom code-based evaluator](code-based-evaluators.md).
+  **Evaluators derived from a base evaluator** – Run an existing built-in or third-party evaluator’s logic on your own model and inference, instead of the model the service picks. For more information, see [Third-party evaluators](third-party-evaluators.md).

This level of customization is particularly valuable when you need to evaluate domain-specific agents, apply unique quality standards, or implement specialized scoring systems. For example, you might create custom evaluation criteria for specific industries like healthcare or finance, or design scoring schemas that align with your organization’s quality metrics.
