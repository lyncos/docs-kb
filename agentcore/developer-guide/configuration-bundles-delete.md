# Delete a configuration bundle
<a name="configuration-bundles-delete"></a>

Delete a configuration bundle and all of its versions. Deletion is asynchronous — the API returns immediately with a `DELETING` status, and the service removes the bundle and its version history in the background.

You cannot delete a bundle that is referenced by an active A/B test. Stop the A/B test first.

## Code samples
<a name="delete-bundle-examples"></a>

**Example**  
Remove the bundle from your project configuration, then deploy to propagate the deletion:  

```
agentcore remove config-bundle

agentcore deploy
```
The CLI prompts you to select which bundle to remove.  
To remove a specific bundle non-interactively (for example, in a script), pass the bundle name with `--name` and skip the confirmation prompt with `-y`:  

```
agentcore remove config-bundle --name MyBundle -y

agentcore deploy
```

```
import boto3

client = boto3.client("bedrock-agentcore-control", region_name="us-west-2")

response = client.delete_configuration_bundle(
    bundleId="myAgentConfig-a1b2c3d4e5"
)

print(f"Bundle ID: {response['bundleId']}")
print(f"Status: {response['status']}")  # DELETING
```

## Request parameters
<a name="delete-bundle-params"></a>


| Parameter | Type | Required | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  `bundleId`  | String | Yes | The ID of the configuration bundle to delete. Passed as a path parameter. | 

## Response
<a name="delete-bundle-response"></a>

The API returns HTTP 202 (Accepted), indicating the deletion has been queued.


| Field | Type | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  `bundleId`  | String | ID of the bundle being deleted. | 
|  `status`  | String | Status of the bundle. Returns `DELETING`. | 

## Deletion behavior
<a name="delete-bundle-behavior"></a>
+ The operation is **idempotent** — calling delete on an already-deleting bundle returns the same response without error.
+ All versions across all branches are deleted along with the bundle.
+ Once deletion completes, the bundle ID and name become available for reuse.
+ If the bundle is referenced by an active A/B test, the delete fails with a `ConflictException`. Stop the A/B test first.

## Errors
<a name="delete-bundle-errors"></a>

|  `ValidationException`  | 400 | Invalid request parameters. | 
|  `ResourceNotFoundException`  | 404 | The specified `bundleId` does not exist. |
