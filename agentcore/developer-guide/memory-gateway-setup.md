# Set up a gateway with a Memory connector target
<a name="memory-gateway-setup"></a>

To front a Memory resource with a gateway, you create a gateway with an inbound authorizer, then add a target that uses the `agentcore-memory` connector.

**Note**  
You can set up the Memory connector through the AWS Management Console, the AWS SDK, and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). This page uses the AWS CLI; for console steps, see [Create a Memory connector using the console](memory-gateway-connector-console.md).

 **Prerequisites** 
+ An AgentCore Memory resource. For more information, see [Create an AgentCore Memory](memory-create-a-memory-store.md).
+ Permissions to create and configure an AgentCore Gateway. For more information, see [Prerequisites for using the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore gateway service](gateway-prerequisites.md).
+ Depending on the outbound credential mode (see [Outbound credential mode](memory-gateway-connector.md#memory-gateway-connector-outbound)): for `GATEWAY_IAM_ROLE`, a gateway execution role that the gateway assumes to call Memory, with its identity policy scoped to only the Memory actions the gateway needs; for `CALLER_IAM_CREDENTIALS`, the caller’s own IAM identity must be permitted to perform the Memory actions, because the gateway forwards that identity to Memory.

 **Steps** 

The following steps use the AWS CLI. For the input and output shapes of each API operation, follow the links to the *Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Control API Reference*. Replace the example names, `memoryId`, and role ARN with your own values.

1. Create a gateway with [CreateGateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore-control/latest/APIReference/API_CreateGateway.html) and choose its inbound authorizer type (`authorizerType`). The authorizer determines how callers authenticate to the gateway and which identity information is available to access-control policies. For more information, see [Inbound and outbound authentication modes](memory-gateway-connector.md#memory-gateway-connector-auth-modes).

   The following example creates a gateway that authenticates end users with OAuth (`CUSTOM_JWT`) — the primary fine-grained access control path. Provide your OpenID Connect provider’s discovery URL and allowed client ids.

   ```
   aws bedrock-agentcore-control create-gateway \
     --name my-memory-gateway \
     --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-gateway-execution-role \
     --authorizer-type CUSTOM_JWT \
     --authorizer-configuration '{
       "customJWTAuthorizer": {
         "discoveryUrl": "https://your-idp.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration",
         "allowedClients": ["your-client-id"]
       }
     }'
   ```

   The response includes the `gatewayId`, `gatewayArn`, and the invocation `gatewayUrl`. Creation is asynchronous; use [GetGateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore-control/latest/APIReference/API_GetGateway.html) to wait until the gateway’s `status` is `READY`.
**Note**  
This example uses OAuth inbound, which always uses the `GATEWAY_IAM_ROLE` outbound credential mode. The `--role-arn` value is the gateway execution role that the gateway uses to call Memory. For other inbound types and outbound modes, see [Inbound and outbound authentication modes](memory-gateway-connector.md#memory-gateway-connector-auth-modes).

1. Add a target to the gateway with [CreateGatewayTarget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore-control/latest/APIReference/API_CreateGatewayTarget.html), using the `agentcore-memory` connector as the target configuration. For `--gateway-identifier`, use the `gatewayId` returned by `CreateGateway` in the previous step. Supply the connector id and the `memoryId` of the Memory resource to front. The target’s `credentialProviderConfigurations` set the outbound credential mode; with OAuth inbound this is `GATEWAY_IAM_ROLE`.

   ```
   aws bedrock-agentcore-control create-gateway-target \
     --gateway-identifier <gateway-id> \
     --name my-memory \
     --target-configuration '{
       "http": {
         "connector": {
           "source": { "connectorId": "agentcore-memory" },
           "parameters": { "memoryId": "your-memory-id" }
         }
       }
     }' \
     --credential-provider-configurations '[
       { "credentialProviderType": "GATEWAY_IAM_ROLE" }
     ]'
   ```

   Target creation is asynchronous; use [GetGatewayTarget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore-control/latest/APIReference/API_GetGatewayTarget.html) to wait until the target’s `status` is `READY`. The target name (`my-memory` here) becomes the prefix of every Cedar action id for this target.

1. Attach a policy engine and add fine-grained access control policies. This step is what enforces per-caller isolation. For the full procedure and Memory-specific policy examples, see [Fine-grained access control for Memory](memory-gateway-fgac.md).

**Note**  
The name you give the target becomes part of every Cedar action id for that target — a target named `<target-name>` produces action ids that begin with `<target-name>___`. Choose a target name you are comfortable referencing in access-control policies.
