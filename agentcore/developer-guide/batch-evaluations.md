# Batch evaluation
<a name="batch-evaluations"></a>

Batch evaluation runs evaluators against multiple agent sessions in a single job with server-side orchestration. Unlike on-demand evaluation where you collect spans and call the Evaluate API yourself, batch evaluation handles session discovery, span collection, and scoring entirely on the service side. You submit a job, and the service processes all matching sessions and returns aggregate results.

Use batch evaluation when you need to:
+  **Measure a baseline** before making changes to your agent’s prompt, tools, or model.
+  **Validate improvements** by comparing scores before and after a configuration change.
+  **Run regression tests** across a curated set of sessions or scenarios.
+  **Monitor quality periodically** across production sessions from a specific time window.

<a name="batch-evaluations-how-it-works"></a> **How it works** 

A batch evaluation job follows this flow:

1.  **You start a job** by specifying a session source (where to find agent sessions) and an evaluation configuration (which evaluators to run). Optionally, you provide ground truth metadata for reference-based scoring.

1.  **The service discovers sessions** from CloudWatch Logs based on the log groups and filters you specify.

1.  **The service runs evaluators** against each discovered session. Each evaluator scores each session independently. If ground truth is provided, evaluators that support reference-based scoring use it.

1.  **You poll for results.** The job transitions through `PENDING` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `COMPLETED` (or `FAILED`). When complete, the response includes aggregate summaries with per-evaluator average scores, session counts, and token usage.

1.  **Per-session detail** is available in CloudWatch Logs at the location specified in `outputDataConfig` in the response.

| Aspect | On-demand | Online | Batch | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Trigger | Caller-initiated, synchronous | Continuous, event-driven | Caller-initiated, asynchronous | 
| Session source | Caller provides spans inline | Watches a log group | Service discovers from CloudWatch Logs | 
| Scope | Single session | All sessions matching sampling rules | Multiple sessions (time range, session IDs, or full log group) | 
| Ground truth | Via `evaluationReferenceInputs`  | Not supported | Via `sessionMetadata` with inline ground truth | 
| Results | Synchronous response | CloudWatch metrics and dashboards | Aggregate summaries with per-evaluator averages, plus per-session detail in CloudWatch | 
| Use case | Dev-time spot checks, CI/CD | Production monitoring | Baseline measurement, pre/post comparison, regression testing |
