## Episode extraction instructions
<a name="episode-extraction-instructions"></a>

```
You are an expert conversation analyst. Your task is to analyze multiple turns of a user's activity — a mix of conversation between the user and an AI assistant and structured JSON events from the user's system — focusing on tool usage, input arguments, reasoning processes, and structured behavioral events.

# Content inside <conversation>
The block below carries a MIX of two payload types, presented in the order they occurred:
- Conversational payloads: dialog turns between the user and the assistant. Each turn is one of `<user>`, `<assistant>`, `<tool>`, or `<other>` (matching the four transport-level roles `USER | ASSISTANT | TOOL | OTHER`).
- JSON payloads: structured events, records, or documents the user's system captured about them (e.g. behavioral events, activity logs, system events, form submissions, profile snapshots). Each JSON payload is rendered inside its own `<json>` element with the JSON body verbatim.

Both payload types are first-class analyzable units. Do NOT skim past `<json>` elements in favor of dialog — structured events often carry the most concrete facts about what the user did or what the system observed. Analyze every element with equal attention.

# Analysis Framework:

## 1. Context Analysis
- Examine all payloads provided within <conversation></conversation> tags
- Each turn will be marked with <turn_[id]></turn_[id]> tags
- Identify the circumstances and context that the assistant or the user's system is responding to in each interaction
- Try to identify or recover the user's overall objective for the entire batch, which may go beyond the given payloads
- When available, incorporate context from <previous_[k]_turns></previous_[k]_turns> tags to understand the user's broader objectives from provided history

## 2. Assistant / System Analysis (Per Unit)
For EACH analyzable unit (one conversational turn OR one JSON payload counts as one unit), analyze what happened:
- **Context**: The circumstances and situation this unit is responding to, and how the acting party's goal connects to the user's overall objective (considering previous interactions when available)
- **Intent**: The primary goal for this specific unit (for a conversational assistant turn: what the assistant aimed to do; for a JSON payload: what event or observation is being recorded)
- **Action**: For conversational turns, which specific tools were used with what input arguments and sequence of execution, or the concrete action/response taken. For JSON payloads, the structured event fields (kind, key values, quantities, categorical states).
- **Reasoning**: For conversational turns, why these tools were chosen, how arguments were determined, and what guided the decision-making. For JSON payloads, what the event fields imply about the user's behavior or state.

## 3. Outcome Assessment (Per Unit)
For EACH unit, using the next unit's context:
- Determine whether the acting party successfully achieved its stated goal
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the action taken —- what worked well and what didn't
- Assess whether the user's overall objective has been satisfied, remains in progress, or is evolving

**Do not include any PII (personally identifiable information) or user-specific data in your output.**

<language_requirement>
- Identify the main language from the <conversation>. Priority order:
  1. If any conversational turns (`<user>` / `<assistant>` / `<tool>` / `<other>`) are present, the main language is the language of the user's narrative sentences in those turns. JSON payloads DO NOT influence language detection when conversation is present.
  2. If no conversational turns are present, the main language is the language of the free-text narrative values inside the `<json>` payloads.
  3. If neither is present — the JSON payloads carry only field names, enums, numbers, and identifiers — use English.
- Proper nouns (place names, restaurant names, dish names, brand names, product names), JSON field/key names, event names (e.g. `VEHICLE_VIEWED`), enum-like tokens, and identifiers do NOT count toward language detection AND remain verbatim in the analysis regardless of the main language.
- Declare the main language in a <language> tag.
- Write the analysis in the main language. Keep proper nouns verbatim; do not let them change the main language.
- If the conversation is in English, ensure that your response is also in English.
</language_requirement>

## Episode extraction output schema
<a name="episode-extraction-output-schema"></a>

```
# Output Format:

Begin your response with a <language> tag declaring the main language of the conversation. Then provide a separate <summary> block for EACH analyzable unit:

<language>
The main language of the conversation (e.g. English, Spanish, Chinese)
</language>

<summary>
<summary_turn>
<turn_id>
The id of the unit that matches the input, e.g. 0, 1, 2, etc.
</turn_id>
<situation>
A brief description of the circumstances and context that the acting party is responding to in this unit, including the user's overall objective (which may go beyond this specific unit) and any relevant history from previous interactions
</situation>
<intent>
The primary goal for this specific unit — what the assistant aimed to accomplish, or what event the system recorded
</intent>
<action>
Briefly describe which actions were taken or specific tools were used (for conversational turns), or which structured event fields are present (for JSON payloads), and what input arguments or parameters/values were involved.
</action>
<thought>
Briefly explain why these specific tools or actions were chosen (for conversational turns), or what the JSON payload fields imply about the user or the system's decision-making. Note what constraints or requirements influenced the approach and what information guided the decision-making.
</thought>
<assessment_assistant>
Start with Yes or No — Whether the acting party successfully achieved its stated goal for this unit.
Then add a brief justification based on the relevant context.
</assessment_assistant>
<assessment_user>
Yes or No - Whether this turn represents the END OF THE CONVERSATION EPISODE (the user's current inquiry has concluded). Then add a brief explanation by considering messages in the next turns: 1. If this turn represents the END OF THE CONVERSATION EPISODE (the user's current inquiry has concluded), then Yes (it is a clear signal that the user's inquiry has concluded). 2. If the user is continuing with new questions or shifting to other task, then Yes (it is a clear signal that the user is finished with the current task and is ready to move on to the next task). 3. If the user is asking for clarification or more information for the current task, indicating that the user's inquiry is in progress, then No (it is a clear signal that the user's inquiry is not yet concluded). 4. If there is no next turn and there is no clear signal showing that the user's inquiry has concluded, then No.
</assessment_user>
</summary_turn>

<summary_turn>
<turn_id>...</turn_id>
<situation>...</situation>
<intent>...</intent>
<action>...</action>
<thought>...</thought>
<assessment_assistant>...</assessment_assistant>
<assessment_user>...</assessment_user>
</summary_turn>

... continue for all turns ...

<summary_turn>
<turn_id>...</turn_id>
<situation>...</situation>
<intent>...</intent>
<action>...</action>
<thought>...</thought>
<assessment_assistant>...</assessment_assistant>
<assessment_user>...</assessment_user>
</summary_turn>
</summary>

Attention: Only output 1-2 sentences for each field. Be concise and avoid lengthy explanations.
Make sure the number of <summary_turn> is the same as the number of units in the input.

## Episode consolidation instructions
<a name="episode-generation-instructions"></a>

```
You are an expert user-activity analyst. Your task is to analyze and summarize a sequence of user activity — a mix of conversation between the user and an AI assistant and structured JSON events from the user's system — provided within <conversation_turns></conversation_turns> tags.

# Analysis Objectives:
- Provide a comprehensive summary covering all key aspects of the interaction and the observed behavior
- Understand the user's underlying needs and motivations across both conversational and non-conversational signals
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the episode in meeting those needs

# Analysis Components:
Examine the sequence through the following dimensions:
**Situation**: The context and circumstances that prompted this episode — what was happening (either in dialog or in the user's structured activity) that led them to seek assistance or generated the observed events?
**Intent**: The user's primary goal, the problem they wanted to solve, or the outcome they sought to achieve.
**Assessment**: A definitive evaluation of whether the user's goal was successfully achieved.
**Justification**: Clear reasoning supported by specific evidence from both conversational and JSON-derived turn summaries.
**Reflection**: Key insights from the sequence of turns, focusing on patterns in tool usage, reasoning processes, decision-making, and observed behavioral events. Identify effective tool selection and argument patterns, reasoning or tool choices to avoid, and actionable recommendations for similar episodes.

<language_requirement>
- Identify the main language from the <conversation_turns>. Use the language of the <situation>, <intent>, and <action> fields inside the <conversation_turns> input.
- The main language is the language of the narrative sentences. Proper nouns inside those sentences (place names, restaurant names, dish names, brand names) do NOT count.
Example: "The user stays at a hotel in 新宿 and visits 下北沢." → main language = English.
- Declare the main language in a <language> tag.
- Write the analysis in the main language. Keep proper nouns verbatim; do not let them change the main language.
- If the main language is in English, ensure that your response is also in English.
</language_requirement>

## Reflection generation instructions
<a name="reflection-generation-instructions"></a>

```
You are an expert at extracting actionable insights from agent task execution trajectories to build reusable knowledge for future tasks.

# Task:
Analyze the provided episodes and their reflection knowledge, and synthesize new reflection knowledge that can guide future scenarios.

# Input:
- **Main Episode**: The primary trajectory to reflect upon (context, goal, and execution steps)
- **Relevant Episodes**: Relevant trajectories that provide additional context and learning opportunities
- **Existing Reflection Knowledge**: Previously generated reflection insights from related episodes (each with an ID) that can be synthesized or expanded upon

# Reflection Process:

## 1. Pattern Identification
- First, review the main episode's user_intent (goal), description (context), turns (actions and thoughts), and reflection/finding (lessons learned)
- Then, review the relevant episodes and identify NEW patterns across episodes
- Review existing reflection knowledge to understand what's already been learned
- When agent system prompt is available, use it to understand the agent's instructions, capabilities, constraints, and requirements
- Finally, determine if patterns update existing knowledge or represent entirely new insights

## 2. Knowledge Synthesis
For each identified pattern, create a reflection entry with:

### Operator
Specify one of the following operations:
- **add**: This is a completely new reflection that addresses patterns not covered by existing reflection knowledge. Do NOT include an <id> field.
- **update**: This reflection is an updated/improved version of an existing reflection from the input. ONLY use "update" when the new pattern shares the SAME core concept or title as an existing reflection. Include the existing reflection's ID in the <id> field.
    - Length constraint: If updating would make the combined use_cases + hints exceed 300 words, create a NEW reflection with "add" instead. Split the pattern into a more specific, focused insight rather than growing the existing one indefinitely.

### ID (only for "update" operator)
If operator is "update", specify the ID of the existing reflection that this new reflection expands upon. This ID comes from the existing reflection knowledge provided in the input.

### Title
Concise, descriptive name for the insight (e.g., "Error Recovery in API Calls", "Efficient File Search Strategies").
    - When updating, keep the same title or a very similar variant to indicate it's the same conceptual pattern.
    - When adding due to length constraint: Use a more specific variant of the title that narrows the scope (e.g., "Error Recovery in API Calls" → "Error Recovery in API Rate Limiting Scenarios")

### Applied Use Cases
Briefly describe when this applies, including:
- The types of goals (based on episode user_intents) where this insight helps
- The problems or challenges this reflection addresses
- Trigger conditions that signal when to use this knowledge

**When updating an existing reflection (within length limit):** Summarize both the original use cases and the new ones into create a comprehensive view.

### Concrete Hints
Briefly describe actionable guidance based on the identified patterns. Examples to include:
- Tool selection and usage patterns from successful episodes
- What worked well and what to avoid (from failures)
- Decision criteria for applying these patterns
- Specific reasoning details and context that explain WHY these patterns work

**When updating an existing reflection (within length limit):** If the new episodes reveal NEW hints, strategies, or patterns not in the existing reflection, ADD them to this section. Summarize both the original hints and the new ones into create a comprehensive view.

### Confidence Score
Score from 0.1 to 1.0 (0.1 increments) indicating how useful this will be for future agents:
- Higher (0.8-1.0): Clear actionable patterns that consistently led to success/failure
- Medium (0.4-0.7): Useful insights but context-dependent or limited evidence
- Lower (0.1-0.3): Tentative patterns that may not generalize well

When updating, adjust the confidence score based on the additional evidence from new episodes.

## 3. Synthesis Guidelines
- **When updating (within length limits)**:
  - Keep the update concise - integrate new insights efficiently without verbose repetition
  - DO NOT lose valuable information from the original reflection
- **When a reflection becomes too long**: Split it into more specific, focused reflections
    - Each new reflection should be self-contained and focused on a specific sub-pattern
- Focus on **transferable** knowledge, not task-specific details
- Emphasize **why** certain approaches work, not just what was done
- Include both positive patterns (what to do) and negative patterns (what to avoid)
- If the existing reflection knowledge already covers the patterns well and no new insights emerge, generate fewer or no new reflections
```

<a name="reflection-generation-output-schema"></a>

```
<attention>
Aim for high-quality reflection entries that either add new learnings or update existing reflection knowledge.
    - Keep reflections focused and split them into more specific patterns when they grow too long.
    - Keep the use_cases and hints focused: Aim for 100-200 words.
    - If it's growing beyond this, consider if you should create a new, more specific reflection instead.
</attention>
