# Get started with Instances using the AWS CLI or SDK
<a name="runtime-instances-get-started-cli"></a>

This tutorial walks through hosting an agent on the **Instances** compute type with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and SDKs. You first create a [capacity provider](runtime-instances-how-it-works.md#runtime-instances-capacity-provider) that defines the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) infrastructure, then create an agent runtime that uses it, and finally invoke the agent.

For the prerequisites, see [Get started with Instances](runtime-instances-getting-started.md).

**Note**  
Parameter names in these examples follow the AgentCore control plane model. For the authoritative request and response shapes, see the [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Control API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore-control/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

## Step 1: Create a capacity provider
<a name="runtime-instances-api-create-cp"></a>

Use the `CreateCapacityProvider` operation to define your EC2 infrastructure. The request takes a `permissionsConfiguration` (the IAM role AgentCore uses to operate the capacity provider) and a `computeConfiguration` that describes the EC2 instances through a launch template. The following example creates a Linux capacity provider with a single allowed instance type and a persistent EBS volume.

**Example**  

1. 

   ```
   aws bedrock-agentcore-control create-capacity-provider \
     --name "my_capacity_provider" \
     --permissions-configuration '{
       "capacityProviderOperatorRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/AgentCoreCapacityProviderOperatorRole"
     }' \
     --compute-configuration '{
       "ec2Configuration": {
         "launchTemplateSource": {
           "launchParameters": {
             "operatingSystem": "LINUX_X86_64",
             "instanceRequirements": {
               "allowedInstanceTypes": ["m5.large"]
             }
           }
         },
         "vpcConfiguration": {
           "subnets": ["subnet-0123456789abcdef0"],
           "securityGroups": ["sg-0123456789abcdef0"]
         },
         "lifecycleConfiguration": {
           "maxLifetime": 3600
         },
         "volumes": [
           { "ebsConfiguration": { "name": "scratch", "sizeGiB": 50, "volumeType": "gp3" } }
         ]
       }
     }'
   ```

1. Python example using boto3 to create a capacity provider.

   ```
   import boto3
   
   client = boto3.client("bedrock-agentcore-control", region_name="us-west-2")
   
   response = client.create_capacity_provider(
       name="my_capacity_provider",
       permissionsConfiguration={
           "capacityProviderOperatorRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/AgentCoreCapacityProviderOperatorRole"
       },
       computeConfiguration={
           "ec2Configuration": {
               "launchTemplateSource": {
                   "launchParameters": {
                       "operatingSystem": "LINUX_X86_64",
                       "instanceRequirements": {
                           "allowedInstanceTypes": ["m5.large"],
                       },
                   }
               },
               "vpcConfiguration": {
                   "subnets": ["subnet-0123456789abcdef0"],
                   "securityGroups": ["sg-0123456789abcdef0"],
               },
               "lifecycleConfiguration": {
                   "maxLifetime": 3600,
               },
               "volumes": [
                   {"ebsConfiguration": {"name": "scratch", "sizeGiB": 50, "volumeType": "gp3"}}
               ],
           }
       },
   )
   
   print(f"Capacity provider ARN: {response['capacityProviderArn']}")
   ```

To run GPU workloads, include a supported GPU instance type in `allowedInstanceTypes`. AgentCore provisions the GPU drivers on the instance, so standard container images work without bundling drivers. The supported families are `g4dn`, `g5`, `g6`, `g6e`, `gr6`, `g6f`, `gr6f`, `g7e`, and `inf2`. If you include an accelerator instance type from an unsupported family, the request fails with a `ValidationException`. For more information, see [Use GPU instance types](runtime-instances-how-it-works.md#runtime-instances-gpu).

Poll `GetCapacityProvider` until the status is `READY` before associating the capacity provider with a runtime. If the status becomes `CREATE_FAILED`, inspect `statusCode` and `statusReason` to determine the cause.

## Step 2: Create an agent runtime on the capacity provider
<a name="runtime-instances-api-create-runtime"></a>

Create an agent runtime with a `capacityProviderConfiguration` that references your capacity provider. To mount a volume defined on the capacity provider into the agent’s filesystem, add a `capacityProviderVolume` entry to `filesystemConfigurations` that references the volume by name. Mount paths must be under `/mnt` with a single subdirectory (for example, `/mnt/scratch`).

The agent runtime has its own `lifecycleConfiguration.maxLifetime`, which defaults to 28800 seconds (8 hours). This value must be less than or equal to the `maxLifetime` that the capacity provider sets in `ec2Configuration.lifecycleConfiguration`. The capacity provider in Step 1 sets that value to 3600 seconds (1 hour), so the runtime default of 8 hours would exceed it and `CreateAgentRuntime` would fail with a `ValidationException`. The following example therefore sets a runtime `maxLifetime` of 1800 seconds, which is within the capacity provider’s limit.

**Note**  
Both resources use a `lifecycleConfiguration` member, but they are different structures. The capacity provider’s version takes `idleInstanceTimeout` and `maxLifetime` and applies to the instance. The agent runtime’s version takes `idleRuntimeSessionTimeout` and `maxLifetime` and applies to the session. For more information, see [Configure Amazon Bedrock AgentCore lifecycle settings](runtime-lifecycle-settings.md).

Do not pass `networkConfiguration` when you specify `capacityProviderConfiguration`. An Instances runtime inherits its networking from the capacity provider’s `ec2Configuration.vpcConfiguration`, so specifying both fails with a `ValidationException`.

**Example**  

1. 

   ```
   aws bedrock-agentcore-control create-agent-runtime \
     --agent-runtime-name "my_instances_agent" \
     --role-arn "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/AgentRuntimeRole" \
     --agent-runtime-artifact '{
       "containerConfiguration": {
         "containerUri": "111122223333.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/my-agent:latest"
       }
     }' \
     --capacity-provider-configuration '{
       "capacityProviderArn": "arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-west-2:111122223333:capacity-provider/my_capacity_provider-a1b2c3d4e5"
     }' \
     --lifecycle-configuration '{
       "idleRuntimeSessionTimeout": 300,
       "maxLifetime": 1800
     }' \
     --filesystem-configurations '[
       {
         "capacityProviderVolume": { "volumeName": "scratch", "mountPath": "/mnt/scratch" }
       }
     ]'
   ```

1. Python example using boto3 to create an agent runtime on Instances.

   ```
   import boto3
   
   client = boto3.client("bedrock-agentcore-control", region_name="us-west-2")
   
   response = client.create_agent_runtime(
       agentRuntimeName="my_instances_agent",
       roleArn="arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/AgentRuntimeRole",
       agentRuntimeArtifact={
           "containerConfiguration": {
               "containerUri": "111122223333.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/my-agent:latest"
           }
       },
       capacityProviderConfiguration={
           "capacityProviderArn": "arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-west-2:111122223333:capacity-provider/my_capacity_provider-a1b2c3d4e5",
       },
       lifecycleConfiguration={
           "idleRuntimeSessionTimeout": 300,
           "maxLifetime": 1800,
       },
       filesystemConfigurations=[
           {
               "capacityProviderVolume": {"volumeName": "scratch", "mountPath": "/mnt/scratch"}
           }
       ],
   )
   
   print(f"Agent runtime ARN: {response['agentRuntimeArn']}")
   ```

## Step 3: Invoke the agent
<a name="runtime-instances-api-invoke"></a>

Invoke the runtime the same way you would a microVM-backed runtime. Reuse the same `runtimeSessionId` across invocations to keep the session on the same instance. This lets your agent access data from previous invocations. To co-locate collaborating agents, use the same `runtimeSessionId` across multiple runtimes that share a capacity provider.

**Example**  

1. 

   ```
   echo '{"prompt": "Analyze the sales data and summarize the key trends."}' > payload.json
   
   aws bedrock-agentcore invoke-agent-runtime \
     --agent-runtime-arn "arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-west-2:111122223333:runtime/my_instances_agent-suffix" \
     --runtime-session-id "project-xyz-0000000000000000000000000000" \
     --qualifier "DEFAULT" \
     --payload fileb://payload.json \
     response.json
   ```

   The `payload` parameter is a binary blob, and the AWS CLI expects blobs to be base64-encoded by default. Passing raw JSON inline, such as `--payload '{"prompt": "…​"}'`, fails client-side with an `Invalid base64` error before the request reaches the service. The `fileb://` form used here reads the file as binary regardless of the `cli_binary_format` setting, so it avoids the encoding step.
The agent’s response is a streaming blob that the AWS CLI writes to the output file you name as the last argument, in this example `response.json`. Standard output carries only the `runtimeSessionId`, `contentType`, and `statusCode` fields, so read the output file to see what your agent returned.    
 AWS SDK  

1. Python example using boto3 to invoke an agent runtime on Instances.

   ```
   import boto3
   import json
   
   client = boto3.client("bedrock-agentcore", region_name="us-west-2")
   
   response = client.invoke_agent_runtime(
       agentRuntimeArn="arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-west-2:111122223333:runtime/my_instances_agent-suffix",
       runtimeSessionId="project-xyz-0000000000000000000000000000",  # 33+ chars; reuse to keep the session
       payload=json.dumps({"prompt": "Analyze the sales data and summarize the key trends."}).encode(),
       qualifier="DEFAULT",
   )
   
   print("Agent response:", json.loads(response["response"].read()))
   ```

The `runtimeSessionId` must be at least 33 characters.

The first invocation for a new session provisions an EC2 instance in your account and launches the agent, so it typically takes longer than later invocations. Subsequent invocations to the same session reuse the running instance and return much faster.

AgentCore provisions these instances as [Amazon EC2 managed instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/amazon-ec2-managed-instances.html), which are hidden from `DescribeInstances` and your EC2 console views by default. A plain `aws ec2 describe-instances` call does not list them. To see them, include managed resources:

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --include-managed-resources \
  --filters "Name=tag-key,Values=bedrock-agentcore:capacity-provider-id"
```

For more information about managing instance visibility, see the [managed resource visibility setting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/amazon-ec2-managed-instances.html#managed-resource-visibility-settings).

## Co-locate multiple agents on one instance
<a name="runtime-instances-multi-agent"></a>

When two agent runtimes reference the **same** capacity provider and you invoke them with the **same** `runtimeSessionId`, both agents run on the same EC2 instance. There, they can share the volume configured in their filesystem configuration. Agents collaborate by reading and writing files on that shared volume — each agent is invoked independently and does not otherwise share state. For example, a test runner can write results to the volume, and a code analyzer invoked on the same session can then read them. For the boundary between agents on a shared instance, see [Security model and permissions for Runtime Instances](runtime-instances-security.md).

```
import boto3
import json

client = boto3.client("bedrock-agentcore", region_name="us-west-2")
session_id = "collab-session-000000000000000000000"

# Agent A — created on capacity provider "my_capacity_provider"
client.invoke_agent_runtime(
    agentRuntimeArn="arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-west-2:111122223333:runtime/test-runner-suffix",
    runtimeSessionId=session_id,
    payload=json.dumps({"prompt": "Run the test suite for project ABC"}).encode(),
    qualifier="DEFAULT",
)

# Agent B — a different runtime that shares the SAME capacity provider and session ID,
# so it runs on the same instance as Agent A and can read the files Agent A wrote to the shared volume.
client.invoke_agent_runtime(
    agentRuntimeArn="arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-west-2:111122223333:runtime/code-analyzer-suffix",
    runtimeSessionId=session_id,
    payload=json.dumps({"prompt": "Analyze the code for project ABC"}).encode(),
    qualifier="DEFAULT",
)
```

Each agent runs with its own IAM credentials derived from its runtime’s execution role, so you can grant the collaborating agents different permissions although they share the same instance. However, because agents on the same instance are not isolated from each other, any agent can potentially read another agent’s credentials. Co-locate only agents that are mutually trusted. For more information, see [Security model and permissions for Runtime Instances](runtime-instances-security.md).

## Clean up: stop and delete sessions
<a name="runtime-instances-stop-delete"></a>

**Warning**  
To avoid ongoing charges for the Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon EBS volumes provisioned in your account, delete the sessions and capacity providers you no longer need when you finish this tutorial.

A session can host multiple agent runtimes on the same instance, so AgentCore provides two distinct operations:
+  **Stop an agent runtime in a session** – `StopRuntimeSession` stops a single agent runtime within a session, identified by the runtime ARN and the session ID. Other agent runtimes that share the same session and instance are unaffected.
+  **Delete a session** – `DeleteCapacityProviderSession` deletes the entire session and deprovisions the EC2 resources created in your account (instance, network interface, and any persistent EBS volumes), so you stop incurring infrastructure and storage costs.

To stop a specific agent runtime on a session, call the [StopRuntimeSession](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/APIReference/API_StopRuntimeSession.html) operation with the runtime ARN and the session ID.

**Example**  

1. 

   ```
   aws bedrock-agentcore stop-runtime-session \
     --agent-runtime-arn "arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-west-2:111122223333:runtime/my_instances_agent-suffix" \
     --runtime-session-id "project-xyz-0000000000000000000000000000"
   ```

1. Python example using boto3 to stop a runtime session.

   ```
   import boto3
   
   client = boto3.client("bedrock-agentcore", region_name="us-west-2")
   
   client.stop_runtime_session(
       agentRuntimeArn="arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-west-2:111122223333:runtime/my_instances_agent-suffix",
       runtimeSessionId="project-xyz-0000000000000000000000000000",
   )
   ```

To delete a session and deprovision all of its resources — including any persistent EBS volumes — call `DeleteCapacityProviderSession` with the capacity provider ID and the session ID. The operation is idempotent and asynchronous: it returns immediately while AgentCore terminates the instance and deletes the volumes in the background.

Session IDs are values that you supply on invocation, and there is no operation that lists the sessions on a capacity provider. Keep a record of the `runtimeSessionId` values you use so that you can delete each session afterwards. If you no longer have them, you can find the instances that are still running, and then delete the capacity provider to deprovision all of its sessions:

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --include-managed-resources \
  --filters "Name=tag-key,Values=bedrock-agentcore:capacity-provider-id" \
  --query 'Reservations[].Instances[?State.Name!=`terminated`].[InstanceId,State.Name]'
```

**Example**  

1. 

   ```
   aws bedrock-agentcore delete-capacity-provider-session \
     --capacity-provider-id "my_capacity_provider-a1b2c3d4e5" \
     --session-id "project-xyz-0000000000000000000000000000"
   ```

1. Python example using boto3 to delete a capacity provider session.

   ```
   import boto3
   
   client = boto3.client("bedrock-agentcore", region_name="us-west-2")
   
   response = client.delete_capacity_provider_session(
       capacityProviderId="my_capacity_provider-a1b2c3d4e5",
       sessionId="project-xyz-0000000000000000000000000000",
   )
   
   print("Session status:", response["status"])
   ```

## Delete a capacity provider
<a name="_delete_a_capacity_provider"></a>

When you no longer need a capacity provider, delete it with the `DeleteCapacityProvider` operation. Deleting a capacity provider stops and deletes all of its associated sessions and their persistent storage, so it also serves as a way to clean up sessions whose IDs you no longer have. You do not need to delete the sessions first. You do, however, need to remove the runtimes that reference the capacity provider: delete the associated versions, endpoints, or runtimes first, or the delete request fails with a `ValidationException`. The operation is asynchronous; identify the capacity provider by its ID.

**Example**  

1. 

   ```
   aws bedrock-agentcore-control delete-capacity-provider \
     --capacity-provider-id "my_capacity_provider-a1b2c3d4e5"
   ```

1. Python example using boto3 to delete a capacity provider.

   ```
   import boto3
   
   client = boto3.client("bedrock-agentcore-control", region_name="us-west-2")
   
   client.delete_capacity_provider(
       capacityProviderId="my_capacity_provider-a1b2c3d4e5",
   )
   ```
