For more information about Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, see the [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/).

### Install required dependencies
<a name="mcp-install-dependencies"></a>

Install the necessary packages for Amazon Bedrock AgentCore development.

To install the required packages, run the following commands:

```
# Install the AgentCore CLI
npm install -g @aws/agentcore
```

```
# Install the AgentCore Python SDK
pip install bedrock-agentcore
```

## Step 1: Install the MCP server
<a name="mcp-install-server"></a>

To install the AgentCore MCP server, add it to your MCP client’s configuration file. Each MCP client stores this configuration in a different location.

### Add MCP server configuration
<a name="mcp-add-configuration"></a>

Choose your MCP client and add the corresponding configuration:

#### For Kiro
<a name="mcp-config-kiro"></a>

Add to `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` (if it doesn’t exist, see [Creating Configuration Files](https://kiro.dev/docs/mcp/configuration/#creating-configuration-files) ):

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bedrock-agentcore-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "awslabs.amazon-bedrock-agentcore-mcp-server@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": [
        "search_agentcore_docs",
        "fetch_agentcore_doc"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Cursor
<a name="mcp-config-cursor"></a>

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` :

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bedrock-agentcore-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "awslabs.amazon-bedrock-agentcore-mcp-server@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": [
        "search_agentcore_docs",
        "fetch_agentcore_doc"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Amazon Q
<a name="mcp-config-q-cli"></a>

The best practice is to configure MCP servers for individual Q CLI agents. For configuration instructions, see [Configuring MCP servers for Amazon Q CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line-mcp-config-CLI.html).

For Amazon Q in IDEs (VS Code and JetBrains), see [Using MCP servers with Amazon Q in your IDE](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/mcp-ide.html).

#### For Claude Code
<a name="mcp-config-claude"></a>

Configuration depends on your installation:
+  **Standalone app** : Add to `~/.claude/mcp.json` 
+  **VS Code extension** : Configure MCP servers through the Claude Code CLI first, then the extension will automatically use them. See the [Claude Code VS Code documentation](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/vs-code) for setup details.

For standalone Claude Code app:

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bedrock-agentcore-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "awslabs.amazon-bedrock-agentcore-mcp-server@latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": [
        "search_agentcore_docs",
        "fetch_agentcore_doc"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Verify MCP server installation
<a name="mcp-verify-installation"></a>

To verify that the MCP server is connected and working successfully, restart your MCP client after adding the configuration and confirm that the following tools are available:
+  `search_agentcore_docs` - Search Amazon Bedrock AgentCore documentation
+  `fetch_agentcore_doc` - Fetch specific Amazon Bedrock AgentCore documentation pages

## Step 2: Transform an existing agent for AgentCore Runtime compatibility
<a name="mcp-transform-agent"></a>

To make your existing AgentCore agent code compatible with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, use the MCP server to guide the transformation process. For example, if you have a Strands AgentCore agent, the transformation helps convert it to be Amazon Bedrock AgentCore-compatible by updating imports, dependencies, and application structure.

### Transform your agent code
<a name="mcp-transform-process"></a>

The MCP server guides your MCP client to make the following changes to your AgentCore agent code:

#### Add runtime library imports
<a name="mcp-add-imports"></a>

The MCP server adds the required AgentCore imports:

```
from bedrock_agentcore.runtime import BedrockAgentCoreApp
```

#### Update dependencies
<a name="mcp-update-dependencies"></a>

The MCP server updates your `requirements.txt` file:

```
bedrock-agentcore
strands-agents
```

#### Initialize the AgentCore application
<a name="mcp-initialize-app"></a>

The MCP server adds application initialization:

```
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()
```

#### Decorate the main entrypoint
<a name="mcp-decorate-entrypoint"></a>

The MCP server converts your handler function:

```
@app.entrypoint
def handler(event, context):
    # Your agent logic here
    pass
```

#### Add application runner
<a name="mcp-add-runner"></a>

The MCP server adds the application runner:

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

### Transformation procedure
<a name="mcp-transform-procedure"></a>

To transform your AgentCore agent, open your existing AgentCore agent file (for example, `weather_agent.py` ) in your MCP client and use your MCP client’s AI assistant with the following prompt:

```
Transform this AgentCore agent code to be compatible with AgentCore runtime. Update the imports, dependencies, and application structure as needed.
```

## Step 3: Deploy your agent to AgentCore Runtime
<a name="mcp-deploy-agent"></a>

After you transform your AgentCore agent for AgentCore Runtime compatibility, deploy it using the AgentCore CLI through your MCP client.

### Deploy using the AgentCore CLI
<a name="mcp-deploy-cli"></a>

The MCP server uses the AgentCore CLI to deploy your AgentCore agent. The deployment process includes:
+ Creating the deployment configuration
+ Building and containerizing the AgentCore agent
+ Deploying to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime
+ Providing the deployment details and AgentCore agent ARN

To deploy your AgentCore agent, use your MCP client’s AI assistant with the following prompt:

```
Deploy this AgentCore agent to AgentCore runtime using the AgentCore CLI.
```

The MCP server executes the necessary CLI commands automatically.

### Verify deployment
<a name="mcp-verify-deployment"></a>

After deployment completes, you receive confirmation with the following details:
+ AgentCore agent ARN
+ Runtime configuration
+ Deployment status

## Step 4: Test your deployed agent
<a name="mcp-test-agent"></a>

Test your deployed AgentCore agent by invoking it through Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime.

### Invoke the agent
<a name="mcp-invoke-agent"></a>

The MCP server uses the AgentCore CLI to invoke your AgentCore agent and display results including:
+ AgentCore agent response
+ Execution logs
+ Performance metrics

To test your deployed AgentCore agent, use your MCP client’s AI assistant with the following prompt:

```
Test the deployed AgentCore agent with a sample request.
```

Review the invocation output:

```
AgentCore Agent Response: Hello! I can help you with weather information.
Execution Time: 1.2s
Status: Success
```

## Next steps
<a name="mcp-next-steps"></a>

After you successfully deploy and test your first AgentCore agent with the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore MCP server, you can explore additional capabilities:
+  *Stateful MCP features* - Build MCP servers with resources, prompts, elicitation, sampling, and progress notifications. See [Stateful MCP server features](mcp-stateful-features.md).
+  *Tool integration* - Connect your AgentCore agent to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway for external tool access
+  *Memory integration* - Add Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory for conversation context
+  *Identity management* - Implement Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Identity for secure access control
+  *Advanced frameworks* - Explore integration with LangGraph, and other frameworks
