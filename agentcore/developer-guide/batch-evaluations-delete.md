# Delete batch evaluation
<a name="batch-evaluations-delete"></a>

Delete a batch evaluation job and its associated metadata. The job must be in a terminal state (`COMPLETED`, `FAILED`, or `STOPPED`) before it can be deleted.

Deleting a batch evaluation removes the job record from `ListBatchEvaluations`. It does not delete per-session evaluation results that were written to CloudWatch Logs.

## Code samples
<a name="delete-batch-eval-examples"></a>

**Example**  

```
import boto3

client = boto3.client("bedrock-agentcore", region_name="us-west-2")

response = client.delete_batch_evaluation(batchEvaluationId=batch_eval_id)
print(f"Deleted: {response['batchEvaluationId']}")
print(f"Status: {response['status']}")
```
To delete your batch evaluation job record from the service and clear local history, use `agentcore archive batch-evaluation`.  

```
# Archive (delete) a batch evaluation job record on the service and clear local history
agentcore archive batch-evaluation -i <batch-evaluation-id>
```
For a still-running job, you must first stop it before archiving:  

```
agentcore stop batch-evaluation -i <batch-evaluation-id>
```
Both subcommands accept `-i, --id <id>`, plus `--region` and `--json`.
