# AWS managed policies for Amazon Bedrock AgentCore
<a name="security-iam-awsmanpol"></a>

An AWS managed policy is a standalone policy that is created and administered by AWS. AWS managed policies are designed to provide permissions for many common use cases so that you can start assigning permissions to users, groups, and roles.

Keep in mind that AWS managed policies might not grant least-privilege permissions for your specific use cases because they’re available for all AWS customers to use. We recommend that you reduce permissions further by defining [customer managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#customer-managed-policies) that are specific to your use cases.

You cannot change the permissions defined in AWS managed policies. If AWS updates the permissions defined in an AWS managed policy, the update affects all principal identities (users, groups, and roles) that the policy is attached to. AWS is most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new AWS service is launched or new API operations become available for existing services.

For more information, see [AWS managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies) in the *IAM User Guide*.

## AWS managed policy: BedrockAgentCoreFullAccess
<a name="security-iam-awsmanpol-BedrockAgentCoreFullAccess"></a>

You can attach [BedrockAgentCoreFullAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/BedrockAgentCoreFullAccess.html) to your users, groups, and roles.

This policy grants permissions that allow full access to the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

 **Permissions details** 

This policy includes the following permissions:
+  `bedrock-agentcore` (Amazon Bedrock Agent Core) – Allows principals full access to all Amazon Bedrock Agent Core resources.
+  `iam` (AWS Identity and Access Management) – Allows principals to list and get information about roles and policies, and to pass roles with "BedrockAgentCore" in the name to the bedrock-agentcore service. Also allows creating service-linked roles for CloudWatch Application Signals, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore network, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore runtime identity, and AgentCore Runtime Instances.
+  `secretsmanager` (AWS Secrets Manager) – Allows principals to create, update, retrieve, and delete secrets with names that begin with "bedrock-agentcore".
+  `kms` (AWS Key Management Service) – Allows principals to list and describe keys, and to decrypt data and generate data keys within the same AWS account when called via the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore service. Also allows principals to create and list AWS KMS grants on customer managed keys that encrypt AgentCore resources, including grants scoped to AgentCore Policy policy engines (and their policies and policy generations) so that policy engines can be encrypted with a customer managed key.
+  `s3` (Amazon Simple Storage Service) – Allows principals to get objects from S3 buckets with names that begin with "bedrock-agentcore-gateway-" when called via the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore service.
+  `lambda` (AWS Lambda) – Allows principals to list Lambda functions.
+  `logs` (Amazon CloudWatch Logs) – Allows principals to access, query, and manage log data in log groups related to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore and Application Signals, including creating log groups and streams.
+  `application-autoscaling` (Application Auto Scaling) – Allows principals to describe scaling policies.
+  `application-signals` (Amazon CloudWatch Application Signals) – Allows principals to retrieve information about application signals and start discovery.
+  `autoscaling` (Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling) – Allows principals to describe Auto Scaling resources.
+  `cloudwatch` (Amazon CloudWatch) – Allows principals to retrieve and list metrics, generate queries, and access other CloudWatch resources.
+  `oam` (Amazon CloudWatch Observability Access Manager) – Allows principals to list sinks.
+  `rum` (Amazon CloudWatch RUM) – Allows principals to retrieve and list RUM resources.
+  `synthetics` (Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics) – Allows principals to describe and get information about Synthetics resources.
+  `xray` (AWS X-Ray) – Allows principals to retrieve trace information, manage trace segment destinations, and work with indexing rules.
+  `ecr` (Amazon Elastic Container Registry) – Allows principals to describe repositories, list images, and describe images.
+  `bedrock` (Amazon Bedrock) – Allows principals to invoke foundation models and inference profiles for evaluation purposes.

### Considerations
<a name="_considerations"></a>

Note the following limitations of this policy:
+  ** `iam:CreateRole` is not included.** When you create certain AgentCore resources (for example, harness or runtime) in the console, you can elect for the console to auto-create the resource’s execution role on your behalf. This requires `iam:CreateRole` permissions, which are not included in this managed policy. For more information, see [Troubleshooting iam:CreateRole authorization in the console](security_iam_troubleshoot.md#security_iam_troubleshoot-createrole).
+  ** `iam:PassRole` is scoped by role name.** When you create certain AgentCore resources (for example, harness or runtime), you must have `iam:PassRole` permissions on the resource’s execution role. This managed policy only includes `iam:PassRole` permissions for roles with names matching `*BedrockAgentCore*`. For more information, see [Troubleshooting iam:PassRole authorization](security_iam_troubleshoot.md#security_iam_troubleshoot-passrole).
+  ** `GetWorkloadAccessTokenForUserId` is included.** This policy grants permission to call `GetWorkloadAccessTokenForUserId`, which allows issuing workload access tokens using a caller-supplied user identifier string without IdP token verification. This is suitable for development and quickstart scenarios. For production deployments, create custom IAM policies that only grant `GetWorkloadAccessTokenForJWT` (which validates the JWT signature, issuer, and expiry) and explicitly deny `GetWorkloadAccessTokenForUserId` if your workloads always have a JWT available. For more information, see [Get workload access token](get-workload-access-token.md).

## AWS managed policy: BedrockAgentCoreNetworkServiceRolePolicy
