# Release notes for Amazon Bedrock AgentCore
<a name="release-notes"></a>

We recommend subscribing to the RSS feed so updates to these notes are delivered to your Inbox.

## September 2026
<a name="_september_2026"></a>

### Harness: Interactive shells (terminals)
<a name="_harness_interactive_shells_terminals_2"></a>

AgentCore harness now supports persistent, interactive shell sessions over WebSocket. A shell runs in the same isolated microVM session as the harness agent and maintains environment variables, the working directory, command history, and running processes across inputs.

You can reconnect to a detached shell and replay up to 256 KB of buffered output, or open as many as 10 independent shells in one harness session. Interactive shells work in the managed default environment and inside a configured custom container.

At launch, connect through the `InvokeAgentRuntimeCommandShell` WebSocket API directly. AgentCore CLI commands and the high-level AgentCore SDK shell helpers don’t support harness targets. For connection details, framing, authentication, errors, and quotas, see [Interactive shells for AgentCore harness](harness-command-shell.md).

### Harness: Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints
<a name="_harness_custom_openai_compatible_endpoints_2"></a>

OpenAI model configurations now accept an optional `apiBase`. Use this field to route direct OpenAI requests through a custom OpenAI-compatible gateway, proxy, self-hosted endpoint, or regional endpoint. See [Models and instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/harness-models.html#harness-model-switching).

### Harness: Lifecycle hooks
<a name="_harness_lifecycle_hooks_2"></a>

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore harness now supports lifecycle hooks at `before_invocation`, `before_tool_call`, `after_tool_call`, and `after_invocation` boundaries, including tool-call hooks for inline functions. Configure an AWS Lambda target to return a synchronous `allow` or `deny` decision that can stop an invocation or skip a tool call. Configure Amazon SNS or Amazon EventBridge targets to receive non-blocking notifications without changing agent-loop behavior. Hook payloads include context for the corresponding lifecycle event, and `InvokeHarness` emits a `hookEvent` for each configured hook that fires.

See [Lifecycle hooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/harness-lifecycle-hooks.html).

### Evaluations: TypeScript agent framework support
<a name="_evaluations_typescript_agent_framework_support_2"></a>

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Evaluations now evaluates agents built with the TypeScript versions of supported frameworks, alongside the Python versions. Supported TypeScript frameworks are Strands Agents, LangGraph, OpenAI Agents, and the Vercel AI SDK (a TypeScript-only framework).

For more information, see [Supported agent frameworks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/supported-frameworks.html).

### Consent Portal for AgentCore Identity
<a name="_consent_portal_for_agentcore_identity_2"></a>

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Identity now offers a Consent Portal, a hosted portal that lets your end users grant consent for an agent to access resources on their behalf. You direct users to the portal’s `portalUrl`, where they review and approve the requested access before the agent proceeds.

A Consent Portal requires an Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway configured with JWT inbound authentication as its source, and an identity provider whose permitted scopes include `openid`. You create and manage portals with the create, get, list, update, and delete consent-portal operations.

See [Consent Portal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/identity-consent-portal.html).

## August 2026

### AWS Agent Registry is now generally available, with auto-detection and customer managed key encryption
<a name="shared_aws_agent_registry_is_now_generally_available_with_auto_detection_and_customer_managed_key_encryption"></a>

 AWS Agent Registry is now generally available. This launch introduces two new features:
+  **Auto-detection with AWS Organizations** — Automatically discover and catalog AgentCore Runtimes and Gateways across your organization’s member accounts into a single registry, with no per-account setup. The catalog stays in sync as resources are created, updated, or deleted and as accounts join or leave the organization. For more information, see [Using AWS Agent Registry with AWS Organizations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/registry-organizations.html).
+  **Customer managed key encryption** — Encrypt registry data at rest with a customer managed key from AWS KMS that you own and control. Specify the key at registry creation time. For more information, see [Data encryption in AWS Agent Registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/registry-data-encryption.html).

### Memory: Ingest content directly into long-term memory
<a name="_memory_ingest_content_directly_into_long_term_memory_2"></a>

AgentCore Memory now supports direct ingestion into long-term memory via IngestData API. See [Ingest content into long-term memory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/long-term-ingest-data.html).

### Memory: Flexible Namespaces
<a name="_memory_flexible_namespaces_2"></a>

AgentCore Memory now supports flexible namespace variables. See [Specify long-term memory organization with namespaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/specify-long-term-memory-organization.html).

### AWS Agent Registry: AWS PrivateLink support
<a name="shared_aws_agent_registry_shared_aws_privatelink_support"></a>

 AWS Agent Registry now supports AWS PrivateLink for private connectivity from your VPC to the service. You can access the registry over an interface VPC endpoint without an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.

 AWS Agent Registry exposes two AWS PrivateLink endpoints:
+ Control plane — `com.amazonaws.region.agent-registry-control` — for registry and record management.
+ Data plane — `com.amazonaws.region.agent-registry` — for record discovery and the registry MCP endpoint.

Endpoint policies match callers by IAM principal. For registries that use SigV4 authorization, you can scope policies to specific IAM principals. For registries that use JWT authorization, set `Principal` to `*` so bearer-token requests can reach the service.

For more information, see [VPC and AWS PrivateLink with AWS Agent Registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/registry-privatelink.html).

### AWS Agent Registry: Cross-account sharing with AWS RAM
<a name="shared_aws_agent_registry_cross_account_sharing_with_shared_aws_ram"></a>

 AWS Agent Registry now supports cross-account sharing through AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM). Choose from four managed permissions (ReadOnly, Consumer, Publisher, Admin) to control what shared accounts can do. RAM manages the resource-based policy on your behalf. For accounts within the same AWS Organization, sharing takes effect automatically; for external accounts, the consumer accepts an invitation.

For more information, see [Sharing a registry across accounts with AWS RAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/registry-cross-account-sharing.html).

### Payments: Coinbase wallet usage is billed through AWS Marketplace
<a name="payments_coinbase_wallet_usage_is_billed_through_shared_aws_marketplace"></a>

To use Coinbase as a payment provider with AgentCore payments, subscribe to the **Coinbase Wallets for AgentCore Payments** listing in AWS Marketplace. The subscription is mandatory and is enforced when you create a Coinbase payment connector and when you perform Coinbase wallet operations, such as creating a payment instrument or processing a payment.

Coinbase wallet usage is metered through AWS Marketplace and billed on your AWS bill based on Coinbase’s public pricing. Your account remains eligible for the Coinbase free tier. This requirement applies to the Coinbase provider only; other providers, such as Stripe (Privy), are not affected.

For more information, see [Subscribe to Coinbase Wallets for AgentCore Payments in AWS Marketplace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/payments-marketplace-subscription.html).

### Memory: Store and extract non-conversational JSON payloads
<a name="_memory_store_and_extract_non_conversational_json_payloads_2"></a>

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory now accepts a `json` payload type on the CreateEvent API. With this payload type, agents can store non-conversational, JSON-formatted data (up to 100 KB) such as behavioral events, activity logs, and system events.

 `json` payloads are also extracted into long-term memory across the semantic, user preference, summarization, and episodic strategies.

See [Create an event](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/short-term-create-event.html).

### Evaluations: Skill evaluators
<a name="_evaluations_skill_evaluators_2"></a>

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Evaluations adds two built-in evaluators for agents that use skills:
+  `Builtin.SkillSelectionAccuracy` — judges whether the skill the agent loaded fits the task, given the catalog of available skills. Returns `Yes` (1.0) or `No` (0.0).
+  `Builtin.SkillInstructionFollowing` — judges how fully the agent followed the loaded skill’s prescribed steps. Returns a five-point rating from `Fully Followed` (1.0) to `Not Followed` (0.0).

Both are tool-level evaluators. AgentCore Evaluations produces one result per skill invocation and anchors each result to the tool call span that loaded the skill. You can use these evaluators with on-demand, batch, and online evaluations.

Custom TOOL\_CALL evaluators can use the same skill signals as the built-in skill evaluators through the `invoked_skill`, `skill_content`, `available_skills`, and `user_message` placeholders.

See [Skill evaluators](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/skill-evaluators.html).

### Payments: Quick create for Coinbase payment connectors
<a name="_payments_quick_create_for_coinbase_payment_connectors_2"></a>

When you create a Coinbase payment connector, you can now choose **Quick create** to have AgentCore payments provision your Coinbase CDP credentials for you. You authorize access through Coinbase in a browser, and the service creates the payment credential provider on your behalf. You do not need to generate or paste Coinbase API keys.

Quick create is available for the Coinbase provider only; Stripe (Privy) connectors continue to use credentials that you supply. For more information, see [Create a Payment Manager and Connector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/payments-create-manager.html).

### Payments: x402 upto scheme and Machine Payments Protocol (MPP) support
<a name="_payments_x402_upto_scheme_and_machine_payments_protocol_mpp_support_2"></a>

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore payments now supports the x402 `upto` scheme and the Machine Payments Protocol (MPP), in addition to the existing x402 `exact` scheme. The `upto` scheme pays a metered amount up to a ceiling and settles through the Permit2 contract.

MPP is an open, HTTP-native payment standard that uses the standard HTTP authentication challenge flow.

With MPP, a merchant returns a `WWW-Authenticate: Payment` challenge in its `402 Payment Required` response. You forward the challenge verbatim to `ProcessPayment` with `paymentType=MPP`, and AgentCore payments parses the challenge, checks the session budget, signs with the wallet, and returns a ready-to-send credential. You retry the original request with the credential in the `Authorization` header. MPP supports the `evm`, `tempo`, and `solana` payment methods, with provider support that varies by connector type.

For more information, see [Process a payment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/payments-process-payment.html) and [Core concepts for AgentCore payments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/payments-concepts.html).

### Evaluations: Third-party evaluators
<a name="_evaluations_third_party_evaluators_2"></a>

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Evaluations now offers evaluators from the DeepEval and AutoEval open source libraries. There are two ways to use them: select a managed third-party evaluator by ID and the service runs it on a model it operates, the same way you use a built-in evaluator; or derive a custom evaluator from a built-in or third-party evaluator to run its logic on your own model and inference. Managed and derived third-party evaluators are discoverable through the `ListEvaluators` API alongside built-in and custom evaluators. See [Third-party evaluators](third-party-evaluators.md).

### Memory, policy, and harness are now available in AWS GovCloud (US-West)
<a name="memory_policy_and_harness_are_now_available_in_shared_aws_govcloud_us_west"></a>

AgentCore memory, policy, and harness are now available in the AWS GovCloud (US-West) Region (`us-gov-west-1`).

You can now give your agents short-term and long-term memory. You can enforce authorization and content policies on agent actions. You can also run agents on the fully managed harness, with no orchestration code and no container to build.

These capabilities join AgentCore runtime, gateway, identity, built-in tools, observability, and evaluations, which were already available in the Region.

For more information about Region support, see [Supported AWS Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agentcore-regions.html). For more information about AgentCore in AWS GovCloud (US), see the [AWS GovCloud (US) documentation for AgentCore](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-bedrock-agentcore.html). For more information about Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, see [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/) on the AWS website.

### Runtime: Instances compute type with capacity providers
<a name="_runtime_instances_compute_type_with_capacity_providers_2"></a>

AgentCore Runtime now offers the **Instances** compute type. Instances runs your agents on AWS managed Amazon EC2 infrastructure in your own AWS account. You define the compute with a capacity provider, which specifies the operating system, allowed instance types, networking, and storage. AgentCore handles provisioning, scaling, and teardown. Instances support persistent sessions of up to 14 days and GPU-accelerated instance types. Multiple agents can collaborate on a shared instance. Your data stays in your account, and you can apply existing Savings Plans and On-Demand Capacity Reservations (ODCRs). At launch, Instances support Linux on `x86_64` and `arm64`. See [Run agents on Instances with capacity providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/runtime-instances-how-it-works.html).

### AWS Agent Registry launches under the new `agent-registry` namespace
<a name="shared_aws_agent_registry_launches_under_the_new_agent_registry_namespace"></a>

 AWS Agent Registry launches under the new `agent-registry` namespace. With AWS Agent Registry, you can create a private, governed catalog of agents, tools, skills, MCP servers, and custom resources, and expose it through the AWS console, control-plane and data-plane APIs, or the registry’s MCP endpoint. This release adds two new discovery APIs (`ListDiscoverableRegistryRecords` for paginated browsing and `BatchGetDiscoverableRegistryRecord` for bulk retrieval), record tagging, a required `recordType` field, and a redesigned **Record directory** console page that unifies browse and search. Available in nine AWS Regions. See [AWS Agent Registry Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/registry.html).

### Gateway: Configurable rate limits
<a name="_gateway_configurable_rate_limits_2"></a>

AgentCore Gateway now supports customer-configurable rate limiting, giving gateway owners fine-grained control over how callers consume gateway resources. Previously, rate limits were service-managed only (a static default per gateway with manual per-account overrides). Customers can now define their own rate limits scoped to specific callers, targets, tools, or models — enabling multi-tenant isolation without application-layer workarounds.

Rate limits use a dimensional scoping model. Each limit defines `dimensionKeys` — the axes along which traffic is bucketed — and `entries` — specific dimension-value combinations with their own rates. Supported dimension types include JWT claims (`$.context.jwt.sub`), IAM principals (`iam.sourceIdentity`), target names, tool names, and qualified model IDs. Wildcard (`*`) catch-all entries provide default rate buckets, while the most-specific-match-wins evaluation model lets you layer group-level fairness with individual-level caps.

Three enforcement metrics are supported:
+  **Requests (RPS/RPM)** — Cap the number of requests per second or per minute. Applies to all target types.
+  **Tokens (TPM)** — Cap token consumption per minute for inference workloads. Applies to inference targets using known operation paths (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages`, `/v1/responses`). Uses pre-check estimation with post-response reconciliation for accurate budget tracking.
+  **Connections** — Cap the rate of new connections opened per second. Protects downstream targets from connection exhaustion independent of request rate.

Multiple limits can be configured on a single gateway and are evaluated using AND semantics — a request must pass all applicable limits. The effective rate is `min(service_managed, customer_configured)`, meaning customers can tighten but never exceed the service ceiling. Setting `rate=0` on an entry acts as an explicit block for that dimension combination, enabling emergency caller isolation without gateway reconfiguration.

Rate limit configuration changes propagate to the data plane fleet within 30 seconds. The system fails open on transient errors — individual enforcement failures allow the affected request rather than blocking customer traffic.

Six API operations manage rate limits: `CreateRateLimit`, `GetRateLimit`, `UpdateRateLimit`, `DeleteRateLimit`, `ListRateLimits`, and `BatchPutRateLimitEntries`. See [Configure rate limits for your AgentCore gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-rate-limits.html).

### Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime: Simplified and increased API rate quotas
<a name="_amazon_bedrock_agentcore_runtime_simplified_and_increased_api_rate_quotas_2"></a>

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime now consolidates its API rate quotas into a smaller set of shared limits with higher default values, making them easier to understand and to scale against.

Data plane requests, including `InvokeAgentRuntime`, now share a single adjustable quota of 1,000 TPS per account, increased from the previous limit of 200 TPS. This single quota is shared across all data plane APIs rather than enforced for each API.

New session creation is now a single adjustable quota of 25 TPS per account, shared across all endpoints. It unifies and replaces the previous per-endpoint limits of 400 transactions per minute for container-image agents and 25 TPS for direct code deployment agents.

Control plane requests are grouped into three shared, non-adjustable quotas, each shared across all APIs in its group rather than enforced for each API: mutation APIs at 50 TPS, Get APIs at 150 TPS, and List APIs at 25 TPS.

Resource quotas (such as active session workloads, agents, versions, and endpoints per account), invocation limits, session storage limits, and lifecycle limits remain unchanged.

### Gateway: Web Search Tool now available in Europe (Ireland) and Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
<a name="_gateway_web_search_tool_now_available_in_europe_ireland_and_asia_pacific_tokyo_2"></a>

The Web Search Tool connector on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway is now available in two new Regions. These Regions are Europe (Ireland) `eu-west-1` and Asia Pacific (Tokyo) `ap-northeast-1`. Agents in these Regions can invoke the `WebSearch` tool to ground responses in current web knowledge without routing traffic outside their Region. The same Amazon-operated web index and knowledge graph that powers US East (N. Virginia) backs these new Regions. AWS infrastructure processes all queries with the same privacy guarantees and zero data egress. All connector versions (`1.1.0` and `1.2.0`) are available, including request-level domain and date filters. Existing agents require no changes—create a gateway and add a `web-search` connector target in the new Region to get started. See [Web Search Tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-target-connector-web-search-tool.html).

## July 2026
<a name="_july_2026"></a>

### Gateway: Web Search connector version 1.2.0 adds request-level filters and target-level include list
<a name="_gateway_web_search_connector_version_1_2_0_adds_request_level_filters_and_target_level_include_list_2"></a>

The AgentCore Gateway Web Search Tool connector adds version `1.2.0`. At the target level, users can now configure a domain include list to restrict searches to a chosen set of domains, in addition to the existing exclude list. Both target-level lists now support up to 100 domains, expanded from the previous limit of 20 on the exclude list. At the request level, agents can pass an optional `filters` object on each `tools/call` request: `domainFilter.include` and `domainFilter.exclude` (up to 100 domains per list), and a `publishedDateFilter` with `from` and `to` bounds (ISO-8601 UTC, inclusive). Request-level filters compose with the target-level exclude and include lists, which remain enforced on every request. See [Web Search Tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-target-connector-web-search-tool.html).

### Identity: Private Key JWT client authentication
<a name="_identity_private_key_jwt_client_authentication_2"></a>

With Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Identity, your agents can now use Private Key JWT client authentication. Instead of a shared OAuth 2.0 client secret, your agents authenticate to a downstream identity provider’s token endpoint using a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) client assertion.

You register a public key with your identity provider while the corresponding private key stays in AWS Key Management Service (KMS). AgentCore Identity calls AWS KMS to sign each assertion, so the private key never leaves KMS and every signing operation is recorded in AWS CloudTrail.

Private Key JWT authentication works across all three grant flows—machine-to-machine (M2M), on-behalf-of (OBO), and user-delegated access—and supports the RS256, PS256, and ES256 signing algorithms. To get started, choose Private Key JWT as the client authentication method when you add an OAuth client in the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore console. See [Private Key JWT client authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/private-key-jwt.html).

### Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Harness: InvokeHarness now streams MCP tool result metadata
<a name="_amazon_bedrock_agentcore_harness_invokeharness_now_streams_mcp_tool_result_metadata_2"></a>

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore harness now surfaces metadata attached to MCP tool results, streaming it in the InvokeHarness response. Previously, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore harness dropped metadata that was included on a tool result before it reached the client. When an MCP tool result includes metadata, you receive it on a dedicated toolResultMetadata delta channel in the InvokeHarness response stream. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore harness automatically splits large metadata into ordered fragments so it streams reliably regardless of size. To consume the metadata, concatenate the toolResultMetadata fragments in the order received and parse the combined result as JSON to recover the original metadata object.

### Runtime: Unified span destination for agents
<a name="_runtime_unified_span_destination_for_agents_2"></a>

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore runtime agents can now deliver spans to the agent’s own Amazon CloudWatch log group (`/aws/bedrock-agentcore/runtimes/<agent_id>-<endpoint_name>`), in the `spans` log stream, instead of the shared `aws/spans` log group. Spans arrive alongside the agent’s structured logs and standard output. With all telemetry in one log group, you can scope access control and encryption to an individual agent and export from a single location.

Set `UNIFIED_TRACES_DESTINATION_ENABLED=true` on an agent runtime to deliver its spans to the agent’s log group, or `=false` to use the shared `aws/spans` log group. Starting July 20, 2026, newly created agents in supported AWS Regions use the agent’s log group by default. Agents created before this date keep the shared `aws/spans` log group unless you opt them in.

This feature requires CloudWatch Transaction Search with trace segments sent to CloudWatch Logs, `logs:PutResourcePolicy` on the agent’s execution role, and ADOT version 0.18.0 or later. See [Add observability to your Amazon Bedrock AgentCore resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability-configure.html).

### Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Evaluations and Optimizations: AWS PrivateLink support
<a name="amazon_bedrock_agentcore_evaluations_and_optimizations_shared_aws_privatelink_support"></a>

With Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Evaluations and Optimizations, you can now call APIs over AWS PrivateLink without traversing the public internet. This covers batch evaluations, online evaluations, recommendations, A/B testing, and configuration bundles. Create a VPC interface endpoint using the service name `com.amazonaws.region.bedrock-agentcore`. Attach endpoint policies to control which principals, actions, and resources are allowed. This feature is available in all commercial AWS Regions where Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Evaluations and Optimizations is available.

### Evaluations: Expanded agent framework support
<a name="_evaluations_expanded_agent_framework_support_2"></a>

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Evaluations now evaluates agents built with OpenAI Agents, LlamaIndex, Google ADK, and Claude Agent SDK, in addition to Strands Agents and LangGraph. Each framework is supported through its OpenTelemetry or OpenInference instrumentation library, and the documentation lists the scope name and recommended version for each combination.

Evaluations also adds generic framework support, which evaluates agents beyond the frameworks listed above. Configure your framework or your own custom instrumentation to emit telemetry in the OpenTelemetry generative AI semantic conventions or the OpenInference semantic conventions, and Evaluations classifies your spans and extracts the values that evaluators need. The documentation lists the scope names, identifying attributes, and content attributes to set.

Each framework has its own page covering how to instrument your agent, how spans are identified, how the service extracts the values it needs, and example spans. See [Supported agent frameworks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/supported-frameworks.html).

### Runtime and Built-in Tools: ActiveSessionCount Metric
<a name="_runtime_and_built_in_tools_activesessioncount_metric_2"></a>

AgentCore runtime and built-in tools now publish an `ActiveSessionCount` metric directly to your AWS account in the `AWS/Bedrock-AgentCore` CloudWatch namespace. This real-time gauge shows how many sessions are currently active, published once per minute per service type. Use the `Service` dimension — with values `AgentCore.Runtime`, `AgentCore.CodeInterpreter`, or `AgentCore.Browser` — to filter by workload type. Use this metric to monitor capacity utilization, set CloudWatch alarms for unexpected usage spikes, and understand your session quota consumption. Available in all AWS Regions where AgentCore runtime is available. See [AgentCore runtime metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability-runtime-metrics.html). == June 2026

### Runtime: Increased Default Service Quotas
<a name="_runtime_increased_default_service_quotas_2"></a>

AgentCore Runtime default service quotas have been increased to support higher-scale workloads. Active session workloads per account are now 5,000 in US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon), and 2,500 in other AWS Regions (previously 1,000 and 500 respectively). The InvokeAgentRuntime API rate has increased from 25 TPS to 200 TPS per agent, per account. The new session creation rate for container deployments has increased from 100 TPM to 400 TPM per endpoint. The new session creation rate for direct code deployments remains at 25 TPS per endpoint. These updated defaults apply automatically to all accounts. See [Service quotas and limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/bedrock-agentcore-limits.html).

### Web Search Tool is now Generally Available
<a name="_web_search_tool_is_now_generally_available_2"></a>

Web Search is a fully managed tool that enables agents to ground responses in current, accurate web knowledge while keeping data residency within your secured AWS environment with zero data egress. Built on Amazon’s search infrastructure, it combines a proprietary web index with structured knowledge graph data. The tool is exposed as a built-in connector target on AgentCore gateway using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), returning ranked results with relevant snippets, source URLs, titles, and publication dates optimized for agentic retrieval. See [Web Search documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/web-search.html).

### AgentCore Policy Now Supports Bedrock Guardrails
<a name="_agentcore_policy_now_supports_bedrock_guardrails_2"></a>

AgentCore now supports Bedrock Guardrails in policy, giving enterprises deeper safety and security controls as they scale AI agents in production. Guardrails evaluates outputs from authorized agent actions and inputs to gateway targets for prompt injection attempts, harmful content, and sensitive data exposure. These checks run at the gateway layer, outside the agent’s code, where the agent cannot reason around them. Because every tool and context source routes through the gateway, every new agent capability is automatically governed by the same security layer. Policies can be authored using natural language or policy-as-code formats. See [Guardrails integration documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-guardrails.html).

### AgentCore Harness is now Generally Available
<a name="_agentcore_harness_is_now_generally_available_2"></a>

The managed AgentCore harness is now generally available in all AWS Regions where AgentCore is supported. You can define an agent with CreateHarness and run it with InvokeHarness, with no orchestration code and no container to build. GA adds built-in memory by default, or bring your own, more model providers through LiteLLM and Bedrock Mantle (which unlocks OpenAI GPT-5.5 and GPT-5.4 and others on Bedrock), the AWS-curated skills catalog with a one-toggle setup, evaluations and optimization, unified observability across capabilities, versioning and endpoints, and export to Strands code. See [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/harness.html).

### Recommendations is now Generally Available
<a name="_recommendations_is_now_generally_available_2"></a>

The agent performance loop capabilities enable teams to continuously improve agent quality using real production data. The recommendations capabilities in AgentCore analyze production traces and evaluation outputs to suggest specific improvements to system prompts and tool descriptions, grounded in how the agent actually behaves. This capability works regardless of where agents run: on AgentCore runtime, AWS Lambda, Amazon EKS, or non-AWS environments. See [Optimization documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/optimization.html).

### Batch Evaluations is now Generally Available
<a name="_batch_evaluations_is_now_generally_available_2"></a>

As part of the agent performance loop, batch evaluation tests recommended changes against a defined test dataset and reports aggregate scores, catching regressions before changes reach production. Teams can validate prompt and tool description improvements with confidence before rolling them out to live traffic. See [Batch Evaluations documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/batch-evaluations-getting-started.html).

### A/B Testing is now Generally Available
<a name="_ab_testing_is_now_generally_available_2"></a>

A/B testing is the validation step in the agent performance loop. The A/B testing capabilities in AgentCore run a controlled comparison between agent versions by splitting live production traffic, providing real evidence that a change works under production conditions before customers commit to it. This capability works regardless of where agents run: on AgentCore runtime, AWS Lambda, Amazon EKS, or non-AWS environments. See [A/B Testing documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/optimization-ab-testing.html).

### Amazon Bedrock Managed Knowledge Base is now Generally Available
<a name="_amazon_bedrock_managed_knowledge_base_is_now_generally_available_2"></a>

Developers can now build production-ready AI agents grounded in enterprise data with Managed Knowledge Bases in AgentCore. Managed Knowledge Base provides a fully managed retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that agents can query through the gateway, eliminating the need to build and maintain custom retrieval infrastructure. Six native connectors (Amazon S3, SharePoint, Confluence, Google Drive, OneDrive, and Web Crawler) handle data ingestion with automatic syncing and managed vector storage. The service supports hybrid search, document ranking, and advanced retrieval orchestration for complex queries, and handles text, video, audio, and image content. See [Managed Knowledge Base documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/knowledge-base.html).

### Failure Insights is now in Public Preview
<a name="_failure_insights_is_now_in_public_preview_2"></a>

New capabilities can now turn production traces into continuous improvement for agents. The failure insights capabilities in AgentCore discover recurring failure patterns across hundreds of agent sessions, including silent behavioral failures that produce no error signal, explain the root cause of each, and rank them by how widespread they are. Customers can enable continuous monitoring with daily or weekly reports, or run a targeted investigation after a deployment or a spike in complaints, with results in minutes. See [Failure Insights documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/optimization-insights.html).

### Gateway: AgentCore Runtime targets are now generally available
<a name="_gateway_agentcore_runtime_targets_are_now_generally_available_2"></a>

You can add an Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime agent as a target on your gateway. Your gateway sends traffic directly to the runtime agent without aggregation or protocol translation. This integration is now generally available (GA). As part of GA, you can provide an API schema for the runtime target so that the gateway policy engine applies guardrails. You can also use request and response interceptor Lambda functions to inspect or transform traffic, and enforce that the runtime accepts invocations only when they originate from your gateway. See [AgentCore Runtime targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-target-http-runtime.html).

### Gateway: HTTP passthrough targets
<a name="_gateway_http_passthrough_targets_2"></a>

AgentCore Gateway now supports HTTP passthrough targets. These targets route traffic through your gateway to any HTTP endpoint without protocol translation. Passthrough targets are ideal for fronting agent URLs, external APIs, application-to-application (A2A) agents, external Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, or custom inference endpoints. They provide a single gateway endpoint with unified authentication, policy enforcement, and observability. You can provide an API schema to enable policy engine features such as guardrails. You can also configure session stickiness so that weighted routing rules keep a session on the same target. See [HTTP passthrough targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-target-http-passthrough.html).

### Gateway: Inference targets
<a name="_gateway_inference_targets_2"></a>

AgentCore Gateway now supports inference targets for fronting model providers. Inference connector targets provide a preconfigured setup for supported providers. Your gateway automatically handles operations, model discovery, model ID translation, and path rewriting. Inference provider targets give you explicit control over the endpoint, model mappings, per-model token limits, operations, and path rewriting. This includes providers that do not have a built-in connector. See [Inference connector targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-target-inference-connector.html) and [Inference provider targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-target-inference-provider.html).

### Gateway: Enforce inbound traffic from the gateway
<a name="_gateway_enforce_inbound_traffic_from_the_gateway_2"></a>

You can now configure an Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime to accept invocations only when they originate from your gateway. This prevents callers from bypassing the gateway and reaching the runtime directly. Source validation works across both inbound authorization types. For IAM (Signature Version 4, or SigV4) runtimes, use a resource-based policy that enforces the `aws:SourceArn` condition key. For OAuth (JSON Web Token, or JWT) runtimes, use `allowedWorkloadConfiguration` to restrict the allowed workload to your gateway. See [AgentCore Runtime targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-target-http-runtime.html).

### AgentCore achieves SOC compliance
<a name="_agentcore_achieves_soc_compliance_2"></a>

AgentCore is now System and Organization Controls (SOC) compliant and in scope for SOC 1, 2, and 3 reports. The service is officially listed on the [AWS Compliant Services in Scope](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/SOC/) page.

### Identity: Reference Existing Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager
<a name="identity_reference_existing_secrets_in_shared_aws_secrets_manager"></a>

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Identity now allows you to reference existing AWS Secrets Manager secret ARNs directly in AgentCore Identity Credential Providers. You can create and manage your secrets in AWS Secrets Manager using your own governance and compliance policies. These policies include custom CMKs, tagging strategies, automatic rotation, and resource policies. You can then reference the existing secret ARN when you configure a Credential Provider in AgentCore Identity. This gives you full ownership of how your secrets are created, classified, and governed, without changing how AgentCore Identity uses them at runtime.

### AgentCore CLI and CDK: Payments Support
<a name="_agentcore_cli_and_cdk_payments_support_2"></a>

The AgentCore CLI (v0.19.0) and CDK constructs (v0.1.0-alpha.36) now include the Payments feature. The `agentcore add payment-manager` and `agentcore add payment-connector` commands create a Payment Manager and Payment Connector via CloudFormation, automatically connected to your Strands agent through the AgentCore SDK’s `AgentCorePaymentsPlugin`. After deploying with `agentcore deploy`, invoke your payments-eligible agent by passing `--payment-instrument-id` and `--payment-user-id` as flags through `agentcore invoke`, along with `--auto-session` to create or reuse a budget-limited session. The CLI also supports interactive TUI wizards for payment setup and `agentcore remove` commands for teardown. Requires CLI version 0.19.0 or later. See the [Payments quick start](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/payments-getting-started.html) for both SDK and CLI paths.

### Runtime: Interactive Shells (Terminals)
<a name="_runtime_interactive_shells_terminals_2"></a>

AgentCore Runtime now supports interactive shell sessions, giving agents persistent terminal access to their sandboxed environment. Unlike one-shot command execution, interactive shells maintain state across commands — environment variables, working directories, and running processes persist for the lifetime of the session. Each runtime session supports up to 10 concurrent shell sessions. See [Interactive Shells (Terminals)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/runtime-get-started-command-shell.html).

### Step Functions integration with AgentCore harness
<a name="_step_functions_integration_with_agentcore_harness_2"></a>

 AWS Step Functions now integrates natively with AgentCore harness, enabling teams to embed agent reasoning steps directly into production workflows. Within a workflow, run multiple harnesses in parallel or sequence, and wrap them with human approval, error handling, or conditional routing steps. Create a new harness inline from the Step Functions visual builder, or reference an existing one with per-invocation overrides to model, system prompt, and tools. Available in all AWS Regions where AgentCore harness is supported. See [Invoke Amazon Bedrock AgentCore harness with Step Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/harness-step-functions.html).

## May 2026
<a name="_may_2026"></a>

### AWS CDK: AgentCore Constructs Graduate to Stable
<a name="shared_aws_cdk_agentcore_constructs_graduate_to_stable"></a>

The aws-bedrockagentcore L2 constructs have graduated from alpha to stable in aws-cdk-lib. Customers can now define AgentCore resources (runtime, memory, gateway, identity, and more) using CDK with full backward-compatibility guarantees, no separate -alpha package required. The Policy submodule remains in alpha. See [CDK release notes](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/releases/tag/v2.255.0).

### Gateway: MCP Sessions
<a name="_gateway_mcp_sessions_2"></a>

AgentCore gateway can now maintain stateful sessions with MCP clients, allowing them to receive a unique Mcp-Session-Id on initialize and track session state (including downstream MCP target sessions, and pending elicitation or sampling request interactions). Sessions are scoped per authenticated user with configurable timeouts (default 1 hour, up to 8 hours). MCP Sessions serves as the foundation for all interactive MCP features below. See [Use MCP sessions with your AgentCore gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-sessions.html).

### Gateway: Response Streaming
<a name="_gateway_response_streaming_2"></a>

AgentCore Gateway now supports Server-Sent-Events (SSE), delivering multiple JSON-RPC messages on a single connection. Previously, the gateway buffered the entire target response and returned only the final result. Now, events from MCP server targets are delivered as they’re produced, enabling the real-time capabilities below.

### Gateway: Elicitation Pass-Through
<a name="_gateway_elicitation_pass_through_2"></a>

MCP servers targets on AgentCore Gateway can now request input from end users mid-tool-execution. The gateway proxies these elicitation requests to the client and routes responses back to the correct downstream server. Supported modes: Form mode — Server sends a structured form (for example, "Confirm you want to proceed with this refund?"), user responds, server continues. URL mode — Server directs the user to a URL (for example, an OAuth consent page), then completes processing once the user finishes. This enables interactive, human-in-the-loop workflows through a managed gateway — no custom infrastructure required. See [Use elicitation with your AgentCore gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-mcp-elicitation.html).

### Gateway: Sampling Messages
<a name="_gateway_sampling_messages_2"></a>

MCP servers can now request LLM completions from the client during tool execution. The gateway transparently relays these server-initiated requests, enabling patterns where tools augment their behavior with model reasoning mid-flight. See [Use sampling with your AgentCore gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-mcp-sampling.html).

### Gateway: Progress Notifications & Logging Notifications
<a name="_gateway_progress_notifications_logging_notifications_2"></a>

Clients now receive real-time progress updates and structured log messages from tools as they execute. Previously, the gateway returned only the final result. Now, long-running operations can report incremental progress and emit diagnostic logs that stream directly to the caller. See documentation for [progress notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-mcp-progress.html) and [logging messages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-mcp-logging.html).

### Harness: Bring-Your-Own File System (Amazon S3 Files and Amazon EFS)
<a name="_harness_bring_your_own_file_system_amazon_s3_files_and_amazon_efs_2"></a>

AgentCore harnesses now support Amazon S3 Files and Amazon EFS access points alongside managed session storage. Attach access points at `CreateHarness` or `UpdateHarness` time and the harness mounts them into every session at a path you specify. Use S3 Files for round-trip with an S3 bucket, EFS for low-latency shared storage, or combine up to five mounts on a single harness. See [Filesystem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/harness-memory.html#harness-filesystem).

### Runtime: Bring-Your-Own File System (Amazon S3 Files and Amazon EFS)
<a name="_runtime_bring_your_own_file_system_amazon_s3_files_and_amazon_efs_2"></a>

Developers can now attach Amazon S3 Files and Amazon EFS access points directly to agent runtimes. AgentCore Runtime mounts the file system into every session at a path you specify, and your agent reads and writes using standard file operations — no custom mount code, no privileged containers, and no download orchestration required. Mount an S3 Files file system for automatic synchronization between file operations and the S3 bucket, or an EFS access point for a shared NFS file system with sub-millisecond latency. This enables agents to load shared skills, prompt templates, or datasets at session start without re-downloading, persist intermediate results across sessions, and collaborate on the same data across multiple agents. Available across all 15 AWS Regions where AgentCore Runtime is supported. See [File system configurations in AgentCore Runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/runtime-filesystem-configurations.html).

### Agent Performance Loop: Optimization, Batch Evaluation, and User Simulation
<a name="_agent_performance_loop_optimization_batch_evaluation_and_user_simulation_2"></a>

Three new capabilities close the observe-evaluate-optimize-deploy loop, enabling teams to continuously improve agent quality using real production data. Optimization analyzes production traces and evaluator outputs to recommend targeted updates to system prompts and tool descriptions, with built-in A/B testing to validate changes before rollout. Batch evaluation replays curated or historical sessions to compare pre/post scores and catch regressions before changes reach end users. User simulation generates realistic, multi-turn conversations using LLM-backed actors to reveal behaviors beyond scripted test cases. See [Optimization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/optimization.html), [Batch Evaluations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/batch-evaluations-getting-started.html), and [User Simulation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/user-simulation.html).

<a name="_amazon_bedrock_agentcore_payments_is_now_in_preview_2"></a>

Teams can now enable AI agents to autonomously access and pay for APIs, MCP servers, web content, and other agents. Built in partnership with Coinbase and Stripe, AgentCore payments is the first managed payment capabilities purpose-built for autonomous agents, handling the full payment lifecycle from wallet authentication through transaction execution to spending governance and observability. As AI agents become more capable and services shift to pay-per-use models built for machine consumption, developers need infrastructure that lets their agents transact without building bespoke billing integrations, credential management, orchestration logic, budgeting, and observability from scratch. See [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/payments.html).

### Runtime: Custom Header Passthrough
<a name="_runtime_custom_header_passthrough_2"></a>

AgentCore now supports passing arbitrary custom headers through to agents, aligned with Gateway’s header propagation model. Previously restricted to `Authorization` and `X-Amzn-Bedrock-AgentCore-Runtime-Custom-*` headers only, customers can now forward headers like transitive authentication tokens and webhook signatures without modification. See [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/runtime-header-allowlist.html).
