# AgentCore harness vs. Runtime
<a name="harness-vs-runtime"></a>

AgentCore harness and AgentCore Runtime solve different parts of the same problem. This page explains the conceptual difference and provides a feature-by-feature comparison to help you choose between them.

## Conceptual difference
<a name="_conceptual_difference"></a>

 **AgentCore Runtime** is a *serverless hosting environment*. You bring agent code - written in any framework or no framework - wrap it with the AgentCore SDK’s `BedrockAgentCoreApp` entrypoint, package it into an ARM64 container, push it to Amazon ECR, and deploy. *The orchestration loop is yours.* To use any other AgentCore primitive (Memory, Gateway, Browser, Code Interpreter, outbound Identity), you call it from your code, typically through the AgentCore SDK. Runtime provides the infrastructure - isolation, scaling, sessions, auth gating, and observability plumbing - while the agent logic is code you write.

 **AgentCore harness** is a *managed agent harness* - the orchestration loop itself is provided, powered by [Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com). You declare what the agent is (model, system prompt, tools, memory, limits) as configuration, and AgentCore runs the loop. Most features are a single config field: switching a model or adding a tool is a config change, not a redeploy. The harness is a managed abstraction that runs inside Runtime - CloudTrail records harness operations under `AWS::BedrockAgentCore::Runtime`.

For nearly every feature, the pattern is the same:
+  **Harness** - configuration, no code.
+  **Runtime** - you write code, usually with the AgentCore SDK plus your framework.

The grid below makes the per-feature exceptions explicit.

## Feature grid
<a name="_feature_grid"></a>

The **Supported?** columns use the following legend:
+  **Yes** (`✅ Yes`) – Supported with no custom code required.
+  **Custom** (`🔵 Custom`) – Supported, but you must maintain your own implementation.
+  **Mixed** (`🟣 Mixed`) – Configuration enables it, but code is required to fully use it.
+  **No** (`❌ No`) – Not supported.
