# Get online evaluation
<a name="get-online-evaluations"></a>

The `GetOnlineEvaluationConfig` API retrieves the complete details and current status of an existing online evaluation configuration. This synchronous operation returns the full configuration including data sources, evaluators, execution status, and operational metadata.

Use this API to monitor the configuration’s lifecycle status (`ACTIVE`, `CREATING`, `CREATE_FAILED`, `UPDATING`, `UPDATE_FAILED`, `DELETING`, or `ERROR`), check current execution status (`ENABLED` or `DISABLED`), and retrieve all configuration parameters including evaluator lists, data source settings, and output destinations.

## Lifecycle status
<a name="lifecycle-status"></a>

The `status` field on an online evaluation configuration reports its lifecycle state, which is separate from the `executionStatus` field that controls whether the evaluation job is actively processing traces.
+  `ACTIVE` – The configuration is fully provisioned and ready to use.
+  `CREATING` – The configuration is being provisioned. Wait for it to transition to `ACTIVE` before updating or deleting.
+  `CREATE_FAILED` – Creation did not complete successfully. You cannot update a configuration in this state; call `DeleteOnlineEvaluationConfig` to remove it and then create a new one.
+  `UPDATING` – An update is in progress. Wait for the operation to complete before making additional changes.
+  `UPDATE_FAILED` – The most recent update did not apply. You can retry by calling `UpdateOnlineEvaluationConfig` again or remove the configuration with `DeleteOnlineEvaluationConfig`.
+  `DELETING` – The configuration is being removed.
+  `ERROR` – A problem occurred that requires your action. Check the `failureReason` field to identify the issue. Common causes include insufficient IAM role access, missing log group permissions, and exceeded service quotas. After fixing the issue, call `UpdateOnlineEvaluationConfig` to retry or `DeleteOnlineEvaluationConfig` to remove the configuration.

## Code samples for AgentCore SDK and AWS SDK
<a name="get-online-evaluation-code-samples"></a>

The following code samples demonstrate how to get online evaluation configuration details using different development approaches. Choose the method that best fits your development environment and preferences.

**Example**  

1. 

   ```
   from bedrock_agentcore_starter_toolkit import Evaluation
   
   # Initialize the evaluation client
   eval_client = Evaluation()
   
   config_id = "config-abc123"
   print(f"\nUsing config_id: {config_id}")
   
   config_details = eval_client.get_online_config(config_id)
   # Display configuration details
   print(f"Config Name: {config_details['onlineEvaluationConfigName']}")
   print(f"Config ID: {config_details['onlineEvaluationConfigId']}")
   print(f"Status: {config_details['status']}")
   ```

1. 

   ```
   import boto3
   
   client = boto3.client('bedrock-agentcore-control')
   
   response = client.get_online_evaluation_config(
       onlineEvaluationConfigId='your_config_id'
   )
   ```

1. 

   ```
   aws bedrock-agentcore-control get-online-evaluation-config \
       --online-evaluation-config-id your_config_id
   ```
