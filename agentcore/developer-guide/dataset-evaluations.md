# Dataset evaluation
<a name="dataset-evaluations"></a>

**Note**  
Dataset evaluation is in public preview. Features and APIs may change before general availability.

Dataset evaluations let you run your agent against a set of scenarios and automatically evaluate the results. Instead of manually invoking your agent, collecting spans, and calling the Evaluate API, a dataset runner orchestrates the entire lifecycle in a single call: invoke the agent, wait for telemetry ingestion, and evaluate.

This is useful for regression testing, benchmark datasets, CI/CD pipelines, baseline measurement, and pre/post comparison after configuration changes.

The AgentCore SDK provides two dataset runners that share the same [dataset schema](dataset-evaluations-schema.md) and ground truth format but differ in where evaluation happens:
+  **On-demand dataset runner** (`OnDemandEvaluationDatasetRunner`) — Collects spans and calls the Evaluate API client-side. Best for dev-time iteration and small datasets.
+  **Batch dataset runner** (`BatchEvaluationRunner`) — Delegates span collection and evaluation to the service via the batch evaluation API. Best for large datasets and production baselines.

 **Choosing a runner** 


| Aspect | On-demand runner | Batch runner | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Span collection | SDK-side via `AgentSpanCollector`  | Server-side; service reads from CloudWatch directly | 
| Evaluate API calls | SDK calls `evaluate()` per evaluator per scenario | SDK calls `startBatchEvaluation()` once | 
| Execution model | Synchronous three-phase pipeline (invoke, wait, evaluate) | Asynchronous four-phase pipeline (invoke, wait, submit, poll) | 
| Results | Structured `EvaluationResult` with per-scenario, per-evaluator detail | Aggregate `BatchEvaluationSummary` with per-evaluator averages, plus per-session detail in CloudWatch | 
| Best for | Dev-time iteration, CI/CD, small datasets, when you need per-scenario detail immediately | Baseline measurement, large datasets, pre/post comparison, when aggregate scores are sufficient | 

 **Prerequisites** 

Both runners require:
+ Python 3.10\+
+ An agent built with a supported framework and instrumentation library. For more information about supported frameworks and instrumentation libraries, see [Supported agent frameworks](supported-frameworks.md).
+ An agent deployed on AgentCore Runtime with observability enabled, or an agent built with a supported framework configured with [AgentCore Observability](observability.md), including Transaction Search. For more information about telemetry setup, see [Telemetry setup and delivery](supported-frameworks-telemetry.md).
+ The AgentCore SDK installed: `pip install bedrock-agentcore` 
+  AWS credentials configured with permissions for `bedrock-agentcore`, `bedrock-agentcore-control`, and `logs` (CloudWatch)
