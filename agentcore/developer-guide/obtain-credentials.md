# Obtain credentials
<a name="obtain-credentials"></a>

AgentCore Identity uses a workload access token to authorize agent access to credentials stored in the vault, and this token contains both the identity of the agent and the identity of the end user on whose behalf the agent is working. AgentCore Runtime will automatically provide a token when invoking an agent that it is hosting. Agents hosted on other systems can retrieve their agent token using the AgentCore SDK.
