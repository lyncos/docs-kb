# Prerequisites
<a name="ondemand-evaluations-prereqs"></a>

Before you run on-demand evaluations, make sure the following are in place.

## Setup
<a name="on-demand-eval-setup"></a>

Set up the following before you run on-demand evaluations:
+ An agent built with a supported framework and instrumentation library. For more information about supported frameworks and instrumentation libraries, see [Supported agent frameworks](supported-frameworks.md).
+ An agent deployed on AgentCore Runtime with observability enabled, or an agent built with a supported framework configured with [AgentCore Observability](observability.md), including Transaction Search. For more information about telemetry setup, see [Telemetry setup and delivery](supported-frameworks-telemetry.md).
+ An agent invoked with telemetry data in CloudWatch Logs. Wait 2–5 minutes for CloudWatch to ingest the telemetry before starting an on-demand evaluation.

Your IAM user or role also needs the following permissions to run on-demand evaluations:

                "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream",
                "bedrock:ConverseStream"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:bedrock:*::foundation-model/*",
                "arn:aws:bedrock:*:*:inference-profile/*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "LambdaInvokeForCodeBasedEvaluators",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "lambda:InvokeFunction",
                "lambda:GetFunction"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:*:*:function:*"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Note**  
The Lambda permissions are only required if you use [Custom code-based evaluator](code-based-evaluators.md). You can scope the Lambda resource ARN to specific functions as needed.
