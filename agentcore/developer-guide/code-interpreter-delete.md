# Deleting an AgentCore Code Interpreter
<a name="code-interpreter-delete"></a>

When you no longer need a Code Interpreter, you can delete it to free up resources and avoid unnecessary charges.

**Important**  
Deleting a Code Interpreter permanently removes it and all its configuration. This action cannot be undone. Make sure all active sessions are stopped before deleting a Code Interpreter.

**Example**  

1. ====== To delete a Code Interpreter using the console

1. Open the AgentCore console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/home\#](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/home#).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Built-in tools**.

1. From the list of code interpreter tools, select the tool you want to delete.

1. Choose **Delete**.

1. In the confirmation dialog, enter the name of the code interpreter to confirm deletion.

1. Choose **Delete** to permanently delete the Code Interpreter.

1. To delete a Code Interpreter using the AWS CLI, use the `delete-code-interpreter` command:

   ```
   aws bedrock-agentcore delete-code-interpreter \
     --region <Region> \
     --code-interpreter-id "<your-code-interpreter-id>"
   ```

1. To delete a Code Interpreter using the AWS SDK for Python, use the `delete_code_interpreter` method:

   ```
   import boto3
   
   # Initialize the boto3 client
   cp_client = boto3.client(
       'bedrock-agentcore-control',
       region_name="<Region>",
       endpoint_url="https://bedrock-agentcore-control.<Region>.amazonaws.com"
   )
   
   # Delete a Code Interpreter
   response = cp_client.delete_code_interpreter(
       codeInterpreterId="<your-code-interpreter-id>"
   )
   
   print("Code Interpreter deleted successfully")
   ```

1. To delete a Code Interpreter instance using the API, use the following call:

   ```
   # Using awscurl
   awscurl -X DELETE "https://bedrock-agentcore-control.<Region>.amazonaws.com/code-interpreters/<your-code-interpreter-id>" \
   -H "Accept: application/json" \
   --service bedrock-agentcore \
   --region <Region>
   ```
