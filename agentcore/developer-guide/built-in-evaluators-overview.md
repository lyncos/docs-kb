# Built-in evaluators
<a name="built-in-evaluators-overview"></a>

Built-in evaluators in AgentCore Evaluations provide pre-configured evaluators for assessing your agents. These evaluators use predefined evaluator models and prompt templates that have been optimized for common evaluation scenarios.

You can use built-in evaluators with on-demand, batch, and online evaluations. To specify a built-in evaluator, use its ID in the following format: `Builtin.EvaluatorName` , such as `Builtin.Helpfulness`.

**Note**  
Built-in evaluator configurations, including their evaluator models and prompt templates, cannot be modified.

For evaluators that only apply when a tool call loads a skill, see [Skill evaluators](skill-evaluators.md).
