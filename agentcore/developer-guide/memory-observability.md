You can monitor usage metrics for your memory in CloudWatch metrics. Some of the critical metrics are displayed in AgentCore Memory console.

 **CloudWatch metrics** : AgentCore Memory emits metrics to CloudWatch under the `Bedrock-AgentCore` namespace. The metrics contains:
+ Data plane usage statistics: CreateEvent/RetrieveMemoryRecord `Invocations` , `Latency` , `Errors` , etc
+ Ingestion metrics: `Invocations` , `Latency` , `Errors` `NumberOfMemoryRecords` for extraction/consolidation step during ingestion in each memory resource.

In addition to CloudWatch metrics, customer can monitor the memory extraction process via CloudWatch logs if they enabled log delivery. Application logs during ingestion will be published to a log group in customer account. Customer can use the application logs to debug any errors encountered during asynchronous ingestion process.
