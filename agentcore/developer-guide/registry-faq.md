# Comprehensive registry migration guide
<a name="registry-faq"></a>

 * AWS Agent Registry — Migrating to the new `agent-registry` namespace* 

## Introduction
<a name="registry-faq-introduction"></a>

As part of the August 6, 2026 launch of the new `agent-registry` namespace, AWS Agent Registry is introducing significant changes to the service principal, data and API model. If you used AWS Agent Registry under the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace, you must complete a migration that spans three areas:

1.  **Namespace and configuration changes** – We are moving AWS Agent Registry from the AWS Bedrock AgentCore namespace into its own dedicated namespace. This namespace change applies only to AWS Agent Registry. All other AgentCore offerings—such as Identity, Gateway, Runtime, and Policy—remain unaffected. For AWS Agent Registry, the service namespace changes from `bedrock-agentcore` to `agent-registry`. This affects every surface that references the service: endpoints, IAM policies, SDK clients, CLI commands, resource ARNs, and observability integrations. You must update your code and infrastructure to use the new namespace.

1.  **API schema changes** – The registry and registry record data models are updated based on customer feedback from the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace. These changes break backward compatibility with the existing API schemas. Your application code that constructs or parses API requests and responses must be updated to reflect the new schema, as part of migrating to the new namespace.

1.  **Data migration** – You must migrate your existing registries and registry records from the old namespace to the new one. We provide migration tooling to extract your data, transform it to the new schema, and load it into the new namespace. The data is migrated to the same account and region — only the namespace changes.

This guide covers each area in detail with before-and-after examples to help you plan and execute your migration.

## What is the migration timeline?
<a name="registry-faq-timeline"></a>

There are two important milestones you must remember for this migration:
+  **August 6, 2026** — The new `agent-registry` namespace for AWS Agent Registry officially launches. Access the service in the [AWS Agent Registry console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/agent-registry/home?region=us-east-1#). If you have existing registries and records, you have simultaneous access to the `bedrock-agentcore` and `agent-registry` namespaces. Migration tooling becomes available in the [agentcore-samples repository](https://github.com/awslabs/agentcore-samples/tree/main/01-features/07-centralize-and-govern-your-ai-infrastructure/03-registry/04-migrate-to-new-namespace) on the GitHub website. You can begin the process of migration.
**Note**  
If you are a new customer without existing registries or records as of August 6, 2026, you cannot access AWS Agent Registry through the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace. Start using AWS Agent Registry directly from the `agent-registry` namespace.
+  **October 30, 2026** — Migration window closes. The old `bedrock-agentcore` namespace shuts down on this date. You lose read/write access to the service and any remaining data in the old namespace. After this date, you must use the `agent-registry` namespace.

## Namespace and configuration changes
<a name="registry-faq-namespace-changes"></a>

The `agent-registry` namespace replaces `bedrock-agentcore` in the following places. This section lists every surface that changes and provides examples of how to update your code.

**Important**  
The namespace changes only affect APIs offered by AWS Agent Registry, but not the rest of AWS Bedrock AgentCore, such as AWS AgentCore Identity. Thus, workload identity and OAuth credential provider resources remain under the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace.

### Service endpoints
<a name="registry-faq-service-endpoints"></a>

Your applications must point to the new endpoint hostnames. The new endpoints use the `.api.aws` domain.


| Surface | Old value | New value | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Data plane endpoint |  `bedrock-agentcore.{region}.amazonaws.com`  |  `agent-registry.{region}.api.aws`  | 
| Control plane endpoint |  `bedrock-agentcore-control.{region}.amazonaws.com`  |  `agent-registry-control.{region}.api.aws`  | 

### IAM and security
<a name="registry-faq-iam-security"></a>

All IAM policies, service control policies (SCPs), and permission boundaries that reference `bedrock-agentcore` must be updated. Resource ARNs also change to reflect the new namespace.


| Surface | Old value | New value | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| IAM action prefix |  `bedrock-agentcore:*`  |  `agent-registry:*`  | 
| Service principal |  `bedrock-agentcore.amazonaws.com`  |  `agent-registry.amazonaws.com`  | 
| Registry ARN |  `arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:{region}:{account}:registry/{id}`  |  `arn:aws:agent-registry:{region}:{account}:registry/{id}`  | 
| Record ARN |  `arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:{region}:{account}:registry/{id}/record/{rid}`  |  `arn:aws:agent-registry:{region}:{account}:registry/{id}/record/{rid}`  | 

If you have automation that parses ARNs or stores them, update those references as well. Custom policies with conditions on the IAM action prefix or service principal must be updated to match the new values. To see the full list of IAM permissions associated with AWS Agent Registry, refer to the [AWS Agent Registry IAM permissions reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/registry-iam-permissions.html).

**Note**  
If you currently use the [BedrockAgentCoreFullAccess](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/BedrockAgentCoreFullAccess.html) AWS Managed Policy for AWS Agent Registry access (see [BedrockAgentCoreFullAccess policy details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.html#security-iam-awsmanpol-BedrockAgentCoreFullAccess)), you must replace it with the new **AgentRegistryFullAccess** managed policy (available on August 6, 2026). The old BedrockAgentCoreFullAccess managed policy will **NOT** be updated to include `agent-registry:*` permissions.

### SDK, CLI, and infrastructure
<a name="registry-faq-sdk-cli-iac"></a>

Update your application code, deployment scripts, and infrastructure-as-code templates to reference the new client class and CLI namespace.


| Surface | Old value | New value | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Dataplane SDK client class |  `BedrockAgentCoreClient`  |  `AgentRegistryClient`  | 
| Controlplane SDK client class |  `BedrockAgentCoreControlClient`  |  `AgentRegistryControlClient`  | 
| CLI namespace |  `aws bedrock-agentcore`  |  `aws agent-registry`  | 
| Service Quotas code |  `bedrock-agentcore`  |  `agent-registry`  | 

If you previously requested custom quota increases under the `bedrock-agentcore` service code, you must re-request them under `agent-registry`.

### Observability and eventing
<a name="registry-faq-observability"></a>

Update any CloudTrail Lake queries, Athena queries, SIEM integrations, EventBridge rules, CloudWatch dashboards, and alarms that reference the old namespace.


| Surface | Old value | New value | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| CloudTrail event source |  `bedrock-agentcore.amazonaws.com`  |  `agent-registry.amazonaws.com`  | 
| EventBridge source |  `aws.bedrock-agentcore`  |  `aws.agent-registry`  | 
| CloudWatch namespace |  `AWS/BedrockAgentCore`  |  `AWS/AgentRegistry`  | 

#### EventBridge notifications
<a name="registry-faq-eventbridge-notifications"></a>

Under the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace, AWS Agent Registry emitted two Amazon EventBridge events under the `aws.bedrock-agentcore` event source. The event source now changes to `aws.agent-registry`, resource ARNs adopt the new namespace, and notification coverage expands to the full registry-record and registry lifecycle. Events continue to go to the **default** EventBridge bus in the resource’s own account. You must update any EventBridge rules that match on the old source or the old detail-type strings.


| Surface | Old value | New value | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Event source |  `aws.bedrock-agentcore`  |  `aws.agent-registry`  | 
| Resource ARN namespace |  `arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:{region}:{account}:registry/…​`  |  `arn:aws:agent-registry:{region}:{account}:registry/…​`  | 
| Event bus | Default bus | Default bus *(unchanged)*  | 
| Registry-record events | 1 detail type (`Registry Record State changed to Pending Approval`) | 5 detail types (full approval lifecycle) | 
| Registry events | 1 detail type (`Registry State transitions from Creating to Ready`) | 7 detail types (full registry lifecycle) | 
| Event `detail` payload |  `registryRecordId`, `registryId` (records) |  *(unchanged)*  | 

**Important**  
The registry (parent) detail type changed from a sentence to a short status string. A rule that matched detail type `Registry State transitions from Creating to Ready` no longer fires — update it to `Registry Ready`. The registry-record detail type `Registry Record State changed to Pending Approval` is unchanged, so rules matching it continue to work after you update the `source`.

 **Registry-record events.** Emitted when a registry record transitions between approval-workflow states. `Resources` is the full record ARN; `detail` contains `registryRecordId` and `registryId`.


| Detail type | Trigger | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `Registry Record State changed to Draft`  | Record version enters `DRAFT`  | 
|  `Registry Record State changed to Pending Approval`  |  `SubmitRegistryRecordForApproval` called *(unchanged)*  | 
|  `Registry Record State changed to Approved`  | Record transitions to `APPROVED`  | 
|  `Registry Record State changed to Rejected`  | Record transitions to `REJECTED`  | 
|  `Registry Record State changed to Deprecated`  | Record transitions to `DEPRECATED`  | 

 **Registry events.** Emitted on registry provisioning and lifecycle transitions. `Resources` is the full registry ARN; `detail` contains `registryId` and `registryName`.


| Detail type | Trigger | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `Registry Creating`  | Registry enters `CREATING`  | 
|  `Registry Ready`  | Registry becomes `READY` *(replaces the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace value `Registry State transitions from Creating to Ready`)*  | 
|  `Registry Create Failed`  | Registry enters `CREATE_FAILED`  | 
|  `Registry Updating`  | Registry enters `UPDATING`  | 
|  `Registry Update Failed`  | Registry enters `UPDATE_FAILED`  | 
|  `Registry Deleting`  | Registry enters `DELETING`  | 
|  `Registry Delete Failed`  | Registry enters `DELETE_FAILED`  | 

 **Example event (registry record).** 

 **Before (`bedrock-agentcore` namespace, to be deprecated):** 

```
{
  "version": "0",
  "detail-type": "Registry Record State changed to Pending Approval",
  "source": "aws.bedrock-agentcore",
  "account": "123456789012",
  "region": "us-west-2",
  "resources": ["arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-west-2:123456789012:registry/REG_ID/record/REC_ID"],
  "detail": { "registryRecordId": "REC_ID", "registryId": "REG_ID" }
}
```

 **After (`agent-registry` namespace):** 

```
{
  "version": "0",
  "detail-type": "Registry Record State changed to Pending Approval",
  "source": "aws.agent-registry",
  "account": "123456789012",
  "region": "us-west-2",
  "resources": ["arn:aws:agent-registry:us-west-2:123456789012:registry/REG_ID/record/REC_ID"],
  "detail": { "registryRecordId": "REC_ID", "registryId": "REG_ID" }
}
```

**Note**  
To match any registry-record state change with a single rule, match on the `source` (`aws.agent-registry`) plus a `detail-type` prefix of `Registry Record State changed to`. To match any registry lifecycle change, match on the `Registry ` detail-type prefix.

### Example: Updating IAM policies
<a name="registry-faq-example-iam"></a>

Replace the action prefix and resource ARN namespace in all your IAM policies.

 **Before (`bedrock-agentcore` namespace, to be deprecated):** 

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",		 	 	 
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "bedrock-agentcore:CreateRegistry",
      "bedrock-agentcore:GetRegistry",
      "bedrock-agentcore:UpdateRegistry",
      "bedrock-agentcore:ListRegistries",
      "bedrock-agentcore:DeleteRegistry",
      "bedrock-agentcore:CreateRegistryRecord",
      "bedrock-agentcore:GetRegistryRecord",
      "bedrock-agentcore:UpdateRegistryRecord",
      "bedrock-agentcore:ListRegistryRecords",
      "bedrock-agentcore:DeleteRegistryRecord",
      "bedrock-agentcore:SubmitRegistryRecordForApproval",
      "bedrock-agentcore:UpdateRegistryRecordStatus",
      "bedrock-agentcore:SearchRegistryRecords"
    ],
    "Resource": ["arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-west-2:123456789012:*"]
  }]
}
```

 **After (`agent-registry` namespace):** 

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",		 	 	 
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "agent-registry:CreateRegistry",
      "agent-registry:GetRegistry",
      "agent-registry:UpdateRegistry",
      "agent-registry:ListRegistries",
      "agent-registry:DeleteRegistry",
      "agent-registry:CreateRegistryRecord",
      "agent-registry:GetRegistryRecord",
      "agent-registry:UpdateRegistryRecord",
      "agent-registry:ListRegistryRecords",
      "agent-registry:DeleteRegistryRecord",
      "agent-registry:SubmitRegistryRecordForApproval",
      "agent-registry:UpdateRegistryRecordStatus",
      "agent-registry:SearchDiscoverableRegistryRecords",
      "agent-registry:ListDiscoverableRegistryRecords",
      "agent-registry:GetDiscoverableRegistryRecord"
    ],
    "Resource": ["arn:aws:agent-registry:us-west-2:123456789012:*"]
  }]
}
```

**Note**  
The `BatchGetDiscoverableRegistryRecord` API does not have its own IAM action. It authorizes each requested record against the `agent-registry:GetDiscoverableRegistryRecord` action. Ensure your policy includes `GetDiscoverableRegistryRecord` to use `BatchGet`.

**Important**  
Workload identity and OAuth credential provider resources remain under the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace. If your registries use URL sync (`source.fromUrl`) with OAuth or IAM credentials, you must retain the following permissions alongside your new `agent-registry:*` permissions:  

```
"bedrock-agentcore:CreateWorkloadIdentity",
"bedrock-agentcore:GetWorkloadIdentity",
"bedrock-agentcore:DeleteWorkloadIdentity"
```
Do not replace every `bedrock-agentcore` action — these identity resources intentionally retain the old namespace.

### Example: Updating SDK client configuration
<a name="registry-faq-example-sdk"></a>

Update the service name, client class, and endpoint URL in your SDK calls.

 **Before (`bedrock-agentcore` namespace, to be deprecated):** 

```
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(region_name="us-west-2")

cp_client = session.client(
    "bedrock-agentcore-control",
    endpoint_url="https://bedrock-agentcore-control.us-west-2.amazonaws.com"
)

dp_client = session.client(
    "bedrock-agentcore",
    endpoint_url="https://bedrock-agentcore.us-west-2.amazonaws.com"
)
```

 **After (`agent-registry` namespace):** 

```
import boto3

session = boto3.Session(region_name="us-west-2")

cp_client = session.client(
    "agent-registry-control",
    endpoint_url="https://agent-registry-control.us-west-2.api.aws"
)

dp_client = session.client(
    "agent-registry",
    endpoint_url="https://agent-registry.us-west-2.api.aws"
)
```

### Example: Updating CLI commands
<a name="registry-faq-example-cli"></a>

Replace the CLI namespace in all scripts and automation.

 **Before (`bedrock-agentcore` namespace, to be deprecated):** 

```
aws bedrock-agentcore-control create-registry \
    --name "MyRegistry" \
    --description "Production registry" \
    --region us-west-2 \
    --endpoint-url https://bedrock-agentcore-control.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
```

 **After (`agent-registry` namespace):** 

```
aws agent-registry-control create-registry \
    --name "MyRegistry" \
    --description "Production registry" \
    --region us-west-2 \
    --endpoint-url https://agent-registry-control.us-west-2.api.aws
```

## API schema changes
<a name="registry-faq-api-schema"></a>

In addition to the namespace migration, we updated the registry and registry record data models in the `agent-registry` namespace. These changes improve the consistency and extensibility of the API based on feedback from the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace. This section covers each change category with before and after examples so you can update your application code.

### Change 1: Registry entity updates
<a name="registry-faq-change-1"></a>

The authorization configuration on the registry resource — which controls how a registry’s data plane is accessed — now sits under a dedicated `discoveryConfiguration` wrapper that makes its purpose explicit. The approval configuration (which controls whether records submitted to `PENDING_APPROVAL` status automatically transition to `APPROVED` status) moves from a boolean to an extensible enum array.

The specific field changes are:
+  `authorizerType` and `authorizerConfiguration` are moved inside a new `discoveryConfiguration` object.
+  `approvalConfiguration.autoApproval` (boolean) is replaced with `approvalConfiguration.autoApprovalRules` (array of enum strings). The value `"APPROVE_ALL"` has the same semantic meaning as `autoApproval: true`. Rules specified in the enum list are applied. Not specifying (null) means approval is needed.

 **Before (`bedrock-agentcore` namespace, to be deprecated):** 

```
{
  "name": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "authorizerConfiguration": { ... },
  "authorizerType": "string",
  "approvalConfiguration": {
    "autoApproval": true
  }
}
```

 **After (`agent-registry` namespace): with Approval ALL** 

```
{
  "name": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "discoveryConfiguration": {
    "authorizerConfiguration": { ... },
    "authorizerType": "string"
  },
  "approvalConfiguration": {
    "autoApprovalRules": ["APPROVE_ALL"]
  }
}
```

 **After (`agent-registry` namespace): with NULL in enum list** 

```
{
  "name": "string",
  "description": "Registry with manual approval only",
  "approvalConfiguration": {
    "autoApprovalRules": []
  }
}
```

### Change 2: New required fields on registry records
<a name="registry-faq-change-2"></a>

Registry records gain two new required top-level fields to support better categorization and deduplication. You must specify both fields when creating a registry record using the `CreateRegistryRecord` API, and you can change them later using the `UpdateRegistryRecord` API.


| Field | Type | Description | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  `name`  | String (required) | A unique identifier within the registry which can be specified by the customer. Every record must have a unique name in the registry. When `recordVersion` is also present, the combination of `name` and `recordVersion` must be unique. | 
|  `recordType`  | Enum (required) | The semantic type of the record. Valid values: `AGENT`, `MCP`, `SKILL`, `CUSTOM`. Determines which primary descriptor key is valid under `descriptors`. You can use APIs like `ListRegistryRecords` and `SearchDiscoverableRegistryRecords` to filter results by this semantic type. | 

### Change 3: Registry record restructuring
<a name="registry-faq-change-3"></a>

The `descriptors` field changes from a discriminated union to a flat keyed structure.

In the previous model, the `descriptorType` field (`MCP`, `A2A`, `AGENT_SKILLS`, `CUSTOM`) determined the inner shape. This coupled descriptor content to a coarse protocol or format classification. That field no longer exists. `recordType`, a separate top-level attribute, replaces it for semantic categorization. The API enforces valid descriptor keys for each `recordType` at runtime rather than structurally in the shape. Each top-level key under `descriptors` now represents a granular primary descriptor type (for example, `a2aAgentCard`, `mcpServer`, `agentSkillsDefinition`, `custom`). Supplementary descriptors (for example, `tools`, `skillMd`) nest under the primary descriptor’s `additionalData`. The `inlineContent` field becomes `data`. The `schemaVersion` and `protocolVersion` fields consolidate into `dataSchemaVersion`.

The top-level `synchronizationConfiguration` attribute becomes `source` and moves inside each descriptor (including `additionalData` children).

The existing `name` field becomes `displayName`, making its meaning more explicit. A net-new `name` field serves as the dedup key and must be unique across all records in a registry. If you specify both `name` and `recordVersion` for the same record, their combination must be unique.

The following fields are renamed:


| Before | After | Notes | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  `name`  |  `displayName`  | Display name of the record. There will also be a new `name` field which is the dedup key. | 
|  `descriptorType`  | Removed | Replaced by the top-level `recordType` field. | 
|  `inlineContent`  |  `data`  | The content payload within each descriptor. | 
|  `schemaVersion` / `protocolVersion`  |  `dataSchemaVersion`  | Unified version field for all descriptor types. | 
|  `synchronizationConfiguration`  |  `source`  | Moved inside each descriptor (including `additionalData` children). | 

 **Before (`bedrock-agentcore` namespace, to be deprecated):** 

```
{
  "recordId": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "descriptorType": "string", // A2A, MCP, AGENT_SKILL, CUSTOM
  "descriptors": {
    "agent": {
      "a2aAgentCard": {
        "inlineContent": "string",
        "schemaVersion": "string"
      }
    },
    "agentSkills": {
      "skillDefinition": {
        "inlineContent": "string",
        "schemaVersion": "string"
      },
      "skillMd": {
        "inlineContent": "string"
      }
    },
    "mcp": {
      "server": {
        "inlineContent": "string",
        "schemaVersion": "string"
      },
      "tools": {
        "inlineContent": "string",
        "protocolVersion": "string"
      }
    },
    "custom": {
      "inlineContent": "string"
    }
  },
  "synchronizationType": "URL",
  "synchronizationConfiguration": {
    "fromUrl": {
      "url": "string",
      "credentialProviderConfigurations": [
        {
          "credentialProvider": { ... },
          "credentialProviderType": "string"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

 **After (`agent-registry` namespace):** 

```
{
  "recordId": "string",
  "displayName": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "recordVersion": "string",
  "recordType": "AGENT" | "MCP" | "SKILL" | "CUSTOM",
  "descriptors": {
    "a2aAgentCard": {
      "data": "string",
      "dataSchemaVersion": "string",
      "source": { "fromUrl": { "url": "string", "credentialProviderConfigurations": [...] } }
    },
    "mcpServer": {
      "data": "string",
      "dataSchemaVersion": "string",
      "source": { "fromUrl": { ... } },
      "additionalData": {
        "tools": { "data": "string", "dataSchemaVersion": "string" }
      }
    },
    "agentSkillsDefinition": {
      "data": "string",
      "dataSchemaVersion": "string",
      "additionalData": {
        "skillMd": { "data": "string", "dataSchemaVersion": "string", "source": { "fromUrl": { ... } } }
      }
    },
    "custom"?: {
      "data": "string"
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

The following constraints apply:

Exactly one primary descriptor key may be populated per record. The valid primary descriptor per `recordType` are:
+  **AGENT:** `a2aAgentCard`, `mcpServer`, `custom` 
+  **MCP:** `mcpServer`, `custom` 
+  **SKILL:** `agentSkillsDefinition`, `custom` 
+  **CUSTOM:** `custom` 

 `source` is per-descriptor rather than a single top-level block. It attaches to descriptors that carry a `source` field in the schema — `mcpServer` and `a2aAgentCard`. The `tools` child (under `mcpServer.additionalData`), the `agentSkillsDefinition` parent, and the `custom` descriptor carry no `source`.

In the `agent-registry` namespace, only `source.fromUrl` is supported.

Auto-synchronization is only triggered for the `mcpServer` and `a2aAgentCard` primary descriptors — that is, MCP and AGENT record types. A `source` on the `skillMd` child is persisted but not used to run sync, and SKILL records cannot be auto-synchronized. CUSTOM records must be created manually by providing `data` directly.

### Change 4: Data plane filter updates
<a name="registry-faq-change-4"></a>

 `SearchRegistryRecords` becomes `SearchDiscoverableRegistryRecords` (`POST /discoverable-records-search`). Its request and response pick up the new field names and data model:
+ Filter by `recordType` (replaces `descriptorType`).
+ Filter by `recordVersion` (replaces `version`).
+ The response returns descriptors in the new format, without `credentialProviderConfigurations`.

The MCP search tool `search_registry_records` becomes `search_discoverable_registry_records`, returns the new descriptor format, and uses the new filter names.

### Change 5: New browsing APIs
<a name="registry-faq-change-5"></a>

Two new data plane APIs support building browsing and catalog experiences over approved records. These APIs do not require any explicit migration; we mention them here as additions to the AWS Agent Registry API model in the `agent-registry` namespace.

 **ListDiscoverableRegistryRecords** — Returns a paginated list of approved registry records. Use this to build browsing interfaces over published content.

```
// HTTP: POST /registries/{registryId}/discoverable-records-list
{
  "registryId": "string",           // path param, required (ARN or ID)
  "maxResults": 1-100,              // query param, optional
  "nextToken": "string",            // query param, optional
  "filters": [ { "name": "recordType", "values": ["MCP"] } ]
}
{
  "registryRecords": [
    {
      "registryArn": "string",
      "recordArn": "string",
      "recordId": "string",
      "name": "string",
      "displayName": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "recordType": "string",
      "recordVersion": "string",
      "status": "string",
      "createdAt": "string",
      "updatedAt": "string"
    }
  ],
  "nextToken": "string"
}
```

 **BatchGetDiscoverableRegistryRecord** — Retrieves full details for a batch of records across one or more registries in a single call.

```
// HTTP: POST /discoverable-records-batch
{
  "entries": [
    { "registryId": "reg-AAA", "recordIds": ["rec-111", "rec-222"] }
  ]
}
{
  "registryRecords": [
    {
      "registryArn": "string",
      "recordArn": "string",
      "recordId": "string",
      "name": "string",
      "displayName": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "recordType": "string",
      "descriptors": { ... },
      "recordVersion": "string",
      "status": "string",
      "createdAt": "string",
      "updatedAt": "string"
    }
  ],
  "errors": [
    {
      "registryId": "string",
      "recordId": "string",
      "errorCode": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND" | "ACCESS_DENIED" | "INTERNAL_ERROR",
      "message": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

The response includes a `registryRecords` array with the full record details and an `errors` array for any records that could not be retrieved.

At launch, exactly one entry (one registry, 1-100 record IDs) is accepted. The grouped shape is forward-compatible with cross-registry batching in future releases.

### Change 6: List APIs adopt structured filters parameter
<a name="registry-faq-change-6"></a>

In the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace, List APIs expose each filterable field as its own query parameter (for example, `--status READY`, `--recordType MCP`). In the `agent-registry` namespace, a single structured `filters` parameter replaces these discrete parameters. The `filters` value is a list of `{ "name": "<dotted.path>", "values": ["<value>"] }` entries where `name` is a dot-delimited attribute path. New filterable fields, including nested ones, become new `name` paths rather than new API parameters. List operations also change from `GET` to `POST`. Pagination parameters (`maxResults`, `nextToken`) are unchanged.

 **Before (`bedrock-agentcore` namespace, to be deprecated):** 

```
GET /registries?status=READY&authorizerType=AWS_IAM
GET /registries/{registryId}/records?name=my-agent&status=APPROVED&recordType=MCP
```

 **After (`agent-registry` namespace):** 

```
// ListRegistries
// POST /registries-list
{
  "filters": [
    { "name": "status", "values": ["READY"] },
    { "name": "discoveryConfiguration.authorizerType", "values": ["AWS_IAM"] }
  ],
  "maxResults": 100,
  "nextToken": "string"
}

// ListRegistryRecords
// POST /registries/{registryId}/records-list
{
  "filters": [
    { "name": "name", "values": ["my-agent"] },
    { "name": "status", "values": ["APPROVED"] },
    { "name": "recordType", "values": ["MCP"] }
  ],
  "maxResults": 100,
  "nextToken": "string"
}
```

## Data migration
<a name="registry-faq-data-migration"></a>

You must migrate your existing registries and registry records from the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace to the `agent-registry` namespace. We provide a migration tool to assist with the migration. The tool handles extraction of existing data, transformation from the old schema to the new schema, and loading into registries in the new namespace. The tool creates new registries in the `agent-registry` namespace within the same account and region. It migrates all existing records from your old registries to the new ones, accounting for namespace and API schema changes.

The migration tool is available in the [agentcore-samples repository](https://github.com/awslabs/agentcore-samples/tree/main/01-features/07-centralize-and-govern-your-ai-infrastructure/03-registry/04-migrate-to-new-namespace) on the GitHub website. For full setup instructions, command reference, and operational guidance, see the repository README.

### Choosing your migration approach
<a name="registry-faq-choosing-approach"></a>

The right approach depends on whether a one-time full migration is sufficient or whether you need unattended execution and the ability to run an incremental load at cutover.

#### Case 1: Simple migration
<a name="_case_1_simple_migration"></a>
+  **Profile:** A one-time full migration is sufficient. You do not need to run incremental loads or leave jobs running unattended.
+  **Approach:** Run the migration tool directly from your terminal or AWS CloudShell. No infrastructure to deploy. The tool connects to the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace, extracts your registries and records, transforms the data to the `agent-registry` schema, and creates them in the new namespace. This is the simplest path and requires no infrastructure deployment.

#### Case 2: Managed migration with AWS Glue
<a name="case_2_managed_migration_with_shared_aws_glue"></a>
+  **Profile:** You prefer unattended execution, or you plan to run both registry versions in parallel for a period and need an incremental load at cutover to capture any records created or updated in the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace after the initial full run.
+  **Approach:** Deploy the migration as AWS Glue jobs using the provided CDK stack. The jobs run in your account without depending on an open terminal session.

  The typical flow is: run a full migration to bring the `agent-registry` namespace up to date, then operate both namespaces in parallel while you validate and update your integrations. When you are ready to cut over, run an incremental load to sync any records that changed during the parallel period, verify, and switch traffic to the `agent-registry` namespace.

#### Case 3: Active-active migration
<a name="_case_3_active_active_migration"></a>
+  **Profile:** You have built a platform or automation pipeline on top of the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace APIs and are continuously writing new records in production.
+  **Approach:** Start with a full migration using the managed AWS Glue-based approach to bring all historical data into the `agent-registry` namespace. Then point your platform or pipeline at the `agent-registry` namespace in addition to the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace — your application writes to both simultaneously. Use this active-active period to validate your integrations and build confidence in the `agent-registry` namespace. Once you are satisfied, cut over all reads and writes to `agent-registry` and decommission the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace integration.

### Verifying your migration
<a name="registry-faq-verifying"></a>

After running the migration, confirm that your data was migrated correctly:
+ List all registries in the new namespace using the `list-registries` CLI command and confirm the count matches your source.
+ For each registry, compare the record count using `list-registry-records`.
+ Spot-check individual records to confirm that descriptors were transformed correctly (field renames, descriptor restructuring).
+ Update your IAM policies, endpoints, and SDK clients as described in the Namespace and configuration changes section.
+ Verify that your applications can successfully read and write using the new namespace.

### Update IAM trust policies for synchronized records
<a name="registry-faq-sync-trust-policy"></a>

If any of your registry records use **Synchronize** with the **IAM role** credential type, you must update the role’s trust policy before running the live load. The service principal that assumes the role changed from `bedrock-agentcore.amazonaws.com` to `agent-registry.amazonaws.com` in the new namespace. Records that use OAuth credentials or no authorization are unaffected.

**Note**  
The migration tool cannot detect this — the tool never assumes the sync role. The registry service assumes it asynchronously after the record is created. If you skip this step, the migrated record arrives in the `agent-registry` namespace pointing at the same role, and synchronization fails until the role trusts the new principal.

Update the trust policy on the role referenced by each affected record.

 **Before (`bedrock-agentcore` namespace, to be deprecated):** 

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": { "Service": "bedrock-agentcore.amazonaws.com" },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

 **After (`agent-registry` namespace):** 

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": { "Service": "agent-registry.amazonaws.com" },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

If a record has already failed for this reason, the migrated record exists in `CREATE_FAILED` status. The migration tool refuses to overwrite a record in a failure status, so fixing the trust policy alone does not resolve it. To recover:

1. Update the trust policy on the affected role.

1. Delete the `CREATE_FAILED` record from the `agent-registry` namespace.

1. Re-run the load.

## FAQ
<a name="registry-faq-questions"></a>

### What is changing in AWS Agent Registry?
<a name="registry-faq-what-is-changing"></a>

 AWS Agent Registry is moving from the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace to the new dedicated `agent-registry` namespace. The migration spans three areas: namespace and configuration changes (endpoints, IAM, SDK, CLI, ARNs, observability), API schema changes (restructured data model for registries and records), and data migration (moving your existing registries and records to the new namespace).

### Can I continue using Registry on the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace?
<a name="registry-faq-continue-using"></a>

Your existing Registry usage on the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace continues to work without interruption during the migration window. However, we recommend that you begin your migration as soon as tooling becomes available to ensure you have sufficient time to complete both data migration and code updates.

However, if you do not have existing registries or records as of August 6, 2026, you cannot access the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace for AWS Agent Registry from August 6, 2026. If you have existing registries or records as of August 6, 2026, you have access to the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace for AWS Agent Registry during the migration window (August 6, 2026 – October 30, 2026).

### Will my data be automatically migrated?
<a name="registry-faq-auto-migrate"></a>

No. You must initiate the migration yourself using the migration tooling that we provide. See the Data migration section for details on the available approaches based on your scale.

### What API schema changes are included?
<a name="registry-faq-api-changes"></a>

In addition to the namespace change, we updated the API data model in six areas: registry entity (authorization config grouped under `discoveryConfiguration`), registry record new fields (`name` and `recordType`), registry record restructuring (descriptors flattened, field renames), search API filter updates (`recordType`, `recordVersion`), new browsing APIs (`ListDiscoverableRegistryRecords`, `BatchGetDiscoverableRegistryRecord`), and structured filters for List operations.

### How long will the data migration take?
<a name="registry-faq-duration"></a>

Migration time depends on the number of registries and records in your account. For accounts with fewer than 100 records, the migration completes in minutes when running locally. For accounts with thousands of records, expect the migration to complete in under 15 minutes when running as a managed job.

### What if I have a large-scale deployment with active writes?
<a name="registry-faq-large-scale"></a>

If you are actively writing data to the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace in production, use the active-active migration approach as described in Case 3. Start with a full migration to bring the `agent-registry` namespace up to date, then write to both namespaces simultaneously to validate your integrations and build confidence in the new namespace. Cut over reads and writes to `agent-registry` when you are ready.
