# Notifications (Amazon EventBridge)
<a name="registry-eventbridge"></a>

**Migration Now Open**  
 AWS Agent Registry has launched under the new `agent-registry` namespace. Support for the public preview `bedrock-agentcore` namespace will be discontinued on October 30, 2026. For migration instructions, see [Comprehensive registry migration guide](registry-faq.md).

## Supported events
<a name="registry-eventbridge-supported-events"></a>

 AWS Agent Registry emits Amazon EventBridge events for registry-record approval-workflow transitions and for registry provisioning and lifecycle transitions. Events are delivered to the **default** EventBridge bus in the resource’s own account.

**Example**  
 **Event source:** `aws.agent-registry`   
 **Registry-record events.** Emitted when a registry record transitions between approval-workflow states. `Resources` is the full record ARN; `detail` contains `registryRecordId` and `registryId`.  


| Detail type | Trigger | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `Registry Record State changed to Draft`  | Record version enters `DRAFT`  | 
|  `Registry Record State changed to Pending Approval`  |  `SubmitRegistryRecordForApproval` called *(unchanged from the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace)*  | 
|  `Registry Record State changed to Approved`  | Record transitions to `APPROVED`  | 
|  `Registry Record State changed to Rejected`  | Record transitions to `REJECTED`  | 
|  `Registry Record State changed to Deprecated`  | Record transitions to `DEPRECATED`  | 
 **Registry events.** Emitted on registry provisioning and lifecycle transitions. `Resources` is the full registry ARN; `detail` contains `registryId` and `registryName` (present when the registry has a name).  


| Detail type | Trigger | 
| --- | --- | 
|  `Registry Creating`  | Registry enters `CREATING`  | 
|  `Registry Ready`  | Registry becomes `READY` *(replaces the `bedrock-agentcore` namespace value `Registry State transitions from Creating to Ready`)*  | 
|  `Registry Create Failed`  | Registry enters `CREATE_FAILED`  | 
|  `Registry Updating`  | Registry enters `UPDATING`  | 
|  `Registry Update Failed`  | Registry enters `UPDATE_FAILED`  | 
|  `Registry Deleting`  | Registry enters `DELETING`  | 
|  `Registry Delete Failed`  | Registry enters `DELETE_FAILED`  | 
 **Event source:** `aws.bedrock-agentcore`   


| Event | Detail type | Trigger | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Record submitted for approval |  `Registry Record State changed to Pending Approval`  |  `SubmitRegistryRecordForApproval` called | 
| Registry moves from Creating to Ready state |  `Registry State transitions from Creating to Ready`  | After a registry completes provisioning | 
To receive additional event types across the full registry-record and registry lifecycle, migrate to the `agent-registry` namespace. For migration details, see [Comprehensive registry migration guide](registry-faq.md).
