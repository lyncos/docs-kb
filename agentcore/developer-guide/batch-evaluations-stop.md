# Stop batch evaluation
<a name="batch-evaluations-stop"></a>

Stop a running batch evaluation job. The job transitions to `STOPPING` and then `STOPPED`. Partial results from sessions that were already evaluated may be available in the response.

Stopping a batch evaluation is useful when you realize the job was started with incorrect parameters, or when you no longer need the results.

## Code samples
<a name="stop-batch-eval-examples"></a>

**Example**  

```
agentcore stop batch-evaluation --id <batch-evaluation-id> [--region <region>] [--json]
```
You can use `-i` as the short alias for `--id`. The `--region` flag specifies the AWS Region (auto-detected if omitted), and `--json` outputs the response as JSON.

```
import boto3

client = boto3.client("bedrock-agentcore", region_name="us-west-2")

response = client.stop_batch_evaluation(batchEvaluationId=batch_eval_id)
print(f"Status: {response['status']}")  # STOPPING or STOPPED
```
