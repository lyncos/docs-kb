# Delete evaluator
<a name="delete-evaluator"></a>

The `DeleteEvaluator` API permanently removes a custom evaluator and all its configuration data. This asynchronous operation is irreversible.

 **Deletion requirements:** The evaluator must not be locked (not referenced by any enabled evaluation configurations) and must be in an Active status. Evaluators in use will return a conflict error.

 **Cleanup process:** The system verifies no active references exist, then permanently removes the evaluator configuration. Any evaluation configurations referencing the deleted evaluator will need to be updated with alternative evaluators.

The API returns the evaluator ARN and deletion status immediately. The evaluator becomes unavailable for use once deletion completes.

## Code samples for AgentCore CLI, AgentCore SDK, and AWS SDK
<a name="delete-evaluators-code-samples"></a>

The following code samples demonstrate how to delete evaluators using different development approaches. Choose the method that best fits your development environment and preferences.

**Example**  

1. 

   ```
   agentcore remove evaluator --name "your_custom_evaluator_name"
   agentcore deploy
   ```

   The `remove` command removes the evaluator from your local project configuration. Run `agentcore deploy` to apply the deletion to your AWS account.
**Note**  
If the evaluator is referenced by an online evaluation configuration, you must first remove it from that configuration or delete the online evaluation configuration entirely before deleting the evaluator.
**Note**  
Run this from inside an AgentCore project directory (created with `agentcore create` ).

1. \* Run `agentcore remove` and select **Evaluator** from the resource type menu.  
![Remove resource type selection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/images/tui/eval-remove-select.png)

1. 

   ```
   from bedrock_agentcore_starter_toolkit import Evaluation
   
   eval_client = Evaluation()
   
   eval_client.delete_evaluator(evaluator_id="your_evaluator_id")
   ```

1. 

   ```
   import boto3
   
   client = boto3.client('bedrock-agentcore-control')
   
   list_configs_response = client.delete_evaluator(evaluatorId='your_evaluator_id')
   ```

1. 

   ```
   aws bedrock-agentcore-control delete-evaluator \
       --evaluator-id 'your_evaluator_id'
   ```

## Console
<a name="delete-evaluator-console"></a>

Permanently remove a custom evaluator using the console interface, which includes confirmation prompts to prevent accidental deletion.

 **To delete a custom evaluator** 

1. Open the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore console.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Evaluation**.

1. Choose **Custom evaluators** next to Evaluation configurations.

1. In the **Custom evaluators** card, view the table that lists the custom evaluators you have created.

1. Choose one of the following methods to delete the evaluator:
   + Choose the custom evaluator name to view its details, then choose **Delete** in the upper right of the details page.
   + Select the custom evaluator so that it is highlighted, then choose **Delete** at the top of the Custom evaluators card.

1. Enter `confirm` to confirm the deletion.

1. Choose **Delete** to delete the evaluator.
