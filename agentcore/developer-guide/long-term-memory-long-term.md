# Use long-term memory
<a name="long-term-memory-long-term"></a>

Long-term memory is enabled by adding one or more memory strategies to a memory resource. These strategies define what kind of information is extracted from conversations and stored persistently. This section guides you through configuring built-in and built-in with overrides strategies to enable long-term memory for your agent.

This section provides examples using the AWS SDK (Boto3). For complete end-to-end examples, see [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory examples](memory-examples.md).
