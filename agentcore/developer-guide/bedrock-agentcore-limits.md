# Quotas for Amazon Bedrock AgentCore
<a name="bedrock-agentcore-limits"></a>

Your AWS account has default quotas, formerly referred to as limits, for each AWS service. Unless otherwise noted, each quota is Region-specific. You can request increases for some quotas, and other quotas cannot be increased.

To request a quota increase, contact AWS support.

## AgentCore harness Service Quotas
<a name="harness-service-limits"></a>

AgentCore harness is a logical resource. Each harness you create is backed by a managed AgentCore Runtime that AgentCore provisions and operates on your behalf. Therefore, harness invocations are bound by the same service quotas that apply to AgentCore Runtime. These quotas include resource allocation, invocation, throttling, lifecycle, and session storage limits. For all applicable quotas, see [AgentCore Runtime Service Quotas](#runtime-service-limits).

For configurable per-invocation controls (such as iteration, timeout, and token caps), see [Control cost with limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/harness-operations.html#harness-limits).

## AgentCore Runtime Service Quotas
<a name="runtime-service-limits"></a>

When working with AgentCore Runtime, you need to be aware of the service limits that apply to your account. These limits help ensure service stability and availability for all users.

### Resource allocation limits
<a name="resource-allocation-limits"></a>

The following table describes the resource allocation limits for AgentCore Runtime. You can request increases for some quotas using the Service Quotas console.


| Limit | Default Value | Adjustable | Notes | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Active session workloads per account | 5,000 in US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon), and 2,500 in other AWS Regions. | Yes | Can be increased via Service Quotas | 
| Total agents per account | 1,000 | Yes | Can be increased via Service Quotas | 
| Versions per agent | 1,000 | Yes | Can be increased via Service Quotas | 
| Endpoints (aliases) per agent | 10 | Yes | Can be increased via Service Quotas | 
| Maximum size for a Docker image in an AgentCore Runtime | 2 GB | No |  | 
| Maximum size for a direct code deployment package (compressed) | 250 MB | No | ZIP file size limit for direct code deployment | 
| Maximum size for a direct code deployment package (uncompressed) | 750 MB | No | Unzipped package size limit for direct code deployment | 
| Maximum hardware allocation per session | 2vCPU/8GB | No | The maximum memory/CPU usage and allocation per Runtime session |

| Agents per capacity provider session | 20 | No | Applies to the Instances compute type. The maximum number of agents that you can run on a single capacity provider session. | 

For more information about service quotas and how to request increases, see [Requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*.

**Note**  
Because the **Instances** compute type provisions Amazon EC2 resources in your own account, your account’s quotas for those resources apply in addition to the AgentCore quotas in the preceding table. AgentCore calls the following services on your behalf to provision and manage instances, which consumes your account’s quotas. For high-throughput workloads, you might need to request increases for the following:  
 **Amazon EC2** – the running instance count for the instance families you select, and the request rates for the instance operations that AgentCore calls, such as `RunInstances`, `CreateFleet`, `DescribeInstances`, `TerminateInstances`, and `CreateTags`. For more information, see [Amazon EC2 service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html).
 **Amazon EBS** – the volume quotas for the volume types you use, and the request rates for the volume operations that AgentCore calls, such as `CreateVolume`, `AttachVolume`, `DetachVolume`, `DeleteVolume`, and `DescribeVolumes`. For more information, see [Quotas for Amazon EBS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-resource-quotas.html).
 **Amazon VPC** – the number of network interfaces, and the request rates for the network interface operations that AgentCore calls, such as `AttachNetworkInterface` and `DescribeNetworkInterfaces`. For more information, see [Amazon VPC quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/amazon-vpc-limits.html).
 **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling** – a single shared quota that applies to all Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling API calls, rather than to an individual operation. This quota isn’t available in the Service Quotas console. To request an increase, open an AWS Support case. For more information, see [Request throttling for the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-quotas.html#api-request-throttling).
To request an increase for a quota that is available in the Service Quotas console, see [Requesting a quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html) in the *Service Quotas User Guide*.
