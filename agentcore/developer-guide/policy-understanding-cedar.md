# Understanding Cedar policies
<a name="policy-understanding-cedar"></a>

Policy in AgentCore uses Cedar policies to control access to AgentCore Gateway tools. This section explains Cedar policy structure, evaluation semantics, and key concepts.

**Note**  
Session-aware rules use temporal policies, which are written in Dogwood (compatible with Cedar) and use a `temporal` block. The Cedar structure and semantics described here still apply. For more information, see [Temporal policies](policy-temporal.md).

## Example policy
<a name="policy-example"></a>

Consider a refund processing tool with these requirements:
+ Only the user "John" can process refunds
+ Refunds are limited to $500 or less

The Cedar policy that enforces these requirements:

```
permit(
  principal is AgentCore::OAuthUser,
  action == AgentCore::Action::"RefundTool___process_refund",
  resource == AgentCore::Gateway::"arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:your-region:your-account-id:gateway/refund-gateway"
)
when {
  principal.hasTag("username") &&
  principal.getTag("username") == "John" &&
  context.input.amount < 500
};
```

This policy allows refund processing only when the user is "John" and the refund amount is less than $500.

## Policy structure
<a name="policy-structure"></a>

Cedar policies consist of three main components:

1.  **Effect** - Determines whether to allow or deny access ( `permit` or `forbid` )

1.  **Scope** - Specifies the principal, action, and resource the policy applies to

1.  **Condition** - Defines additional logic that must be satisfied ( `when` or `unless` ) and can refer to the tool parameters (through the context) and the OAuth token (through the tags)

## Policy effects
<a name="policy-effects"></a>

Cedar policies use two effects to control access:
+  `permit` - Allows the action to proceed
+  `forbid` - Denies the action

## Default deny
<a name="policy-default-deny"></a>

All actions are denied by default. If no policies match a request, Cedar returns DENY. You must explicitly write permit policies to allow actions.

## Authorization evaluation
<a name="policy-authorization-evaluation"></a>

Cedar uses a forbid-overrides-permit evaluation model:

1. Cedar evaluates all policies that apply to the request

1. If any forbid policy matches, the result is DENY

1. If at least one permit policy matches and no forbid policies does, the result is ALLOW

1. If no policies match, the result is DENY (default deny)

## Policy isolation
<a name="policy-isolation"></a>

Each Cedar policy evaluates independently. A policy’s evaluation depends only on:
+ The scope (principal, action, resource)
+ The context and tags

Policies do not reference or depend on other policies.

## Policy evaluation algorithm
<a name="policy-evaluation-algorithm"></a>

When a request is evaluated, the policy engine determines the authorization decision using the following algorithm:

1. If any `forbid` policy matches the request, the decision is DENY.

1. If no `forbid` policy matches the request and at least one `permit` policy matches, the decision is ALLOW.

1. If neither `forbid` nor `permit` policies match the request, the decision is DENY.

This evaluation model enforces a **default deny** posture.

A `forbid` policy can never result in an ALLOW decision. The `unless` clause on a `forbid` policy specifies conditions under which that `forbid` policy does not apply; it does **not** grant permission and does not override a matching `permit` policy.
