# Create an AgentCore gateway using the API
<a name="gateway-create-api"></a>

To create a AgentCore gateway using the API, make a [CreateGateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore-control/latest/APIReference/API_CreateGateway.html) request with one of the [AgentCore control plane endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/bedrock_agentcore.html#bedrock_agentcore_cp).

Minimally, you must specify the following fields:
+  `name` – The name of the gateway.
+  `roleArn` – The ARN of the gateway service role. For more information, see [AgentCore Gateway service role permissions](gateway-prerequisites-permissions.md#gateway-service-role-permissions).
+  `authorizerType` – The type of authorizer to use for the gateway. Depends on the inbound authorization that you set up. For more information, see [Set up inbound authorization for your gateway](gateway-inbound-auth.md).

The following optional fields add metadata to your gateway:
+  `protocolType` – The protocol type for the gateway. If you set this to `MCP`, the gateway operates in aggregation mode and can only have MCP targets. If you omit this field, the gateway can have both MCP and HTTP targets.
+  `description` – A description of the gateway.
+  `tags` – A dictionary of key-value pairs specifying tags that you can use to label your gateway for monitoring purposes.

The remaining fields depend on your gateway configuration and whether you want to toggle custom features for your gateway:
+  `clientToken` – A client token value to ensure that a request completes no more than once. If you don’t include this token, one is randomly generated for you. If you don’t include a value, one is randomly generated for you. For more information, see [Ensuring idempotency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/latest/devguide/ec2-api-idempotency.html).
+  `authorizerConfiguration` – If your authorizer type is `CUSTOM_JWT` , you must include this field to specify the gateway authorization and authentication parameters. For more information, see [The authorizer configuration](#gateway-create-api-authorizer-config).
+  `kmsKeyArn` – To encrypt your gateway with a KMS key include the ARN of the key in this field. For more information, see [Encrypt your AgentCore gateway with a customer-managed KMS key](gateway-encryption.md).
+  `exceptionLevel` – To turn on debugging messages when invoking the gateway, set this value to `DEBUG` . For more information, see [Turn on debugging messages](gateway-debug-messages.md) . For examples of creating a gateway with this setting, see [Create a gateway with debugging messages](#gateway-create-ex-debug).
+  `interceptorConfigurations` – To turn on custom code that is run when invoking your gateway, include this field. For more information, see [Using interceptors with Gateway](gateway-interceptors.md) . For examples of creating a gateway with interceptors, see [Create a gateway with interceptor configurations](#gateway-create-ex-basic-interceptors).
+  `protocolConfiguration` – To include customizations for the gateway protocol, configure the settings in this field. For options in this configuration, see [GatewayProtocolConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore-control/latest/APIReference/API_GatewayProtocolConfiguration.html).
  + One example option is the addition of a tool search tool in your gateway. For more information, see [Search for tools in your AgentCore gateway with a natural language query](gateway-using-mcp-semantic-search.md) . For examples of creating a gateway with this search tool, see [Create a gateway with semantic search](#gateway-create-ex-semantic).

## The authorizer configuration
<a name="gateway-create-api-authorizer-config"></a>

If your authorizer type is `CUSTOM_JWT` , you must also include an authorizer configuration in the `authorizerConfiguration` field. The basic structure of the authorizer configuration is as follows:

```
{
  "customJWTAuthorizer": {
    "discoveryUrl": "string",
    "allowedAudience": ["string"],
    "allowedClients": ["string"],
    "allowedScopes": ["string"],
    "customClaims": see below
  }
}
```

You must provide the discovery URL for the authentication token. The remaining fields define restrictions for the authentication claims:
+  `allowedAudience` – The audiences or services that can handle the JWT.
+  `allowedClients` – The clients that are allowed to create a JWT.
+  `allowedScopes` – The scopes of that limit the set of claims.
+  `customClaims` – An array of objects that allows you to define custom fields and values that limit the claims to be authenticated. Each object is a `CustomClaimValidationsType` object contains the following fields:
  +  `inboundTokenClaimName` – The name of the custom claim field to check.
  +  `inboundTokenClaimValueType` – The data type of the claim value to check for.
  +  `authorizingClaimMatchValue` – Defines the value to match the claim value to. Contains the following fields:
    +  `claimMatchOperator` – Defines the relationship to look for between the match value and claim value.
    +  `claimMatchValue` – An object that contains only one of the following fields:
      + matchValueString – Used in the following situations:
        + If the `inboundTokenClaimValueType` is `STRING` and the `claimMatchOperator` is `EQUALS` , specify a string that you want the claim value to match with for authentication.
        + If the `inboundTokenClaimValueType` is `STRING_ARRAY` and the `claimMatchOperator` is `CONTAINS` , specify a string that you want the claim value array to contain for authentication.
      +  `matchValueArray` – If the `inboundTokenClaimValueType` is `STRING_ARRAY` and the `claimMatchOperator` is `CONTAINS_ANY` , specify an array of values that you want to check for authentication. If any of the values in the claim value array matches any of the values in the `matchValueArray` , the claim can be authenticated.

The following examples show the structure of the CustomClaimValidationsType objects that you can specify:

**Example**  

1. 

   ```
   {
     "inboundTokenClaimName": "string",
     "inboundTokenClaimValueType": "STRING",
     "authorizingClaimMatchValue": {
       "claimMatchValue": {
         "matchValueString": "string"
       },
       "claimMatchOperator": "EQUALS"
     }
   }
   ```

1. 

   ```
   {
     "inboundTokenClaimName": "string",
     "inboundTokenClaimValueType": "STRING_ARRAY",
     "authorizingClaimMatchValue": {
       "claimMatchValue": {
         "matchValueString": "string"
       },
       "claimMatchOperator": "CONTAINS"
     }
   }
   ```

1. 

   ```
   {
     "inboundTokenClaimName": "string",
     "inboundTokenClaimValueType": "STRING_ARRAY",
     "authorizingClaimMatchValue": {
       "claimMatchValue": {
         "matchValueStringList": ["string"]
       },
       "claimMatchOperator": "CONTAINS_ANY"
     }
   }
   ```

**Topics**

## Create a gateway: basic example (Custom JWT authorization)
<a name="gateway-create-ex-basic-jwt"></a>

This section provides basic examples of creating a gateway.

**Note**  
Note the following: \* The values for the authorization configuration are from when you set up [inbound authorization](gateway-inbound-auth.md) . \* If you choose an option that involves specifying an overt gateway service role ARN, ensure that you specify an existing one that you’ve set up. For more information, see [AgentCore Gateway service role permissions](gateway-prerequisites-permissions.md#gateway-service-role-permissions).

Select one of the following methods:

**Example**  

1. The AgentCore CLI provides a simple way to create a gateway in a command line interface.

   To create the gateway, you use the `agentcore add gateway` command. The gateway service role and Amazon Cognito authorization are automatically configured for you during deployment.

    **Using default arguments** 

   Run the following command in a terminal to create a gateway with no authorization (the default). To add Custom JWT authorization, specify the authorizer flags as shown in the next example:

   ```
   agentcore add gateway --name my-gateway
   ```

    **Specifying arguments** 

   The following command shows how to create a gateway with Custom JWT authorization and explicit configuration:

   ```
   agentcore add gateway \
     --name my-gateway \
     --authorizer-type CUSTOM_JWT \
     --discovery-url "https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/some-user-pool/.well-known/openid-configuration" \
     --allowed-audience "api.example.com"
   agentcore deploy
   ```

   After deployment, the `gatewayUrl` shown by **agentcore status** is the endpoint to use when you invoke the gateway.

1. Run `agentcore` to open the TUI, then select **add** and choose **Gateway** :

1. Enter the gateway name:  
![Gateway wizard: enter name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/images/tui/gateway-add-name.png)

1. Select **Custom JWT** as the authorizer type and press **Enter** :  
![Gateway wizard: select Custom JWT authorizer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/images/tui/gateway-add-auth-jwt.png)

1. Configure advanced options:  
![Gateway wizard: advanced configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/images/tui/gateway-add-advanced.png)

1. Review the configuration summary and press **Enter** to confirm:  
![Gateway wizard: review configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/images/tui/gateway-add-confirm.png)

1. Run the following code in a terminal to create a basic gateway with the AWS CLI:

   ```
   aws bedrock-agentcore-control create-gateway \
     --name my-gateway \
     --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-gateway-service-role \
     --protocol-type MCP \
     --authorizer-type CUSTOM_JWT \
     --authorizer-configuration '{
       "customJWTAuthorizer": {
         "discoveryUrl": "https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/some-user-pool/.well-known/openid-configuration",
         "allowedClients": ["clientId"]
       }
     }'
   ```

   The `gatewayUrl` in the response is the endpoint to use when you invoke the gateway.

1. The following Python code shows how to create a basic gateway with the AWS Python SDK (Boto3):

   ```
   import boto3
   
   # Initialize the AgentCore client
   client = boto3.client('bedrock-agentcore-control')
   
   # Create a gateway
   gateway = client.create_gateway(
     name="my-gateway",
     roleArn="arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-gateway-service-role",
     protocolType="MCP",
     authorizerType="CUSTOM_JWT",
     authorizerConfiguration={
         "customJWTAuthorizer": {
             "discoveryUrl": "https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/some-user-pool/.well-known/openid-configuration",
             "allowedClients": ["clientId"]
         }
     }
   )
   
   print(f"MCP Endpoint: {gateway['gatewayUrl']}")
   ```

## Create a gateway: basic example (IAM authorization)
<a name="gateway-create-ex-basic-iam"></a>

This section provides basic examples of creating a gateway using IAM authorization. With IAM authorization, you don’t need an authorizer configuration.

**Note**  
The AgentCore CLI does not support creating gateways with IAM authorization. Use the AWS Command Line Interface or AWS Python SDK (Boto3) to create a gateway with IAM authorization.

Select one of the following methods:

**Example**  

1. Run the following in a terminal:

   ```
   aws bedrock-agentcore-control create-gateway \
   --name my-gateway \
   --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyAgentCoreServiceRole \
   --protocol-type MCP \
   --authorizer-type AWS_IAM
   ```

1. 

   ```
   import boto3
   
   # Create the AgentCore client
   agentcore_client = boto3.client('bedrock-agentcore-control')
   
   # Create a gateway
   gateway = agentcore_client.create_gateway(
     name="my-gateway",
     roleArn="arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyAgentCoreServiceRole",
     protocolType="MCP",
     authorizerType="AWS_IAM"
   )
   ```

## Create a gateway: basic example (NONE authorizer)
<a name="gateway-create-ex-basic-none-auth"></a>

This section provides basic examples of creating a gateway with a NONE authorizer type. This represents a gateway that will not perform authentication or authorization for any incoming requests.

**Note**  
\* The NONE authorizer type represents a gateway that will not perform authentication or authorization for any incoming requests. See [inbound authorization](gateway-inbound-auth.md) for security concerns and details around using this configuration. \* If you choose an option that involves specifying an overt gateway service role ARN, ensure that you specify an existing one that you’ve set up. For more information, see [AgentCore Gateway service role permissions](gateway-prerequisites-permissions.md#gateway-service-role-permissions).

Select one of the following methods:

**Example**  

1. The AgentCore CLI provides a simple way to create a gateway with NONE authorizer type in a command line interface.

   The following command shows how to create a gateway with NONE authorizer type:

   ```
   agentcore add gateway \
     --name my-gateway \
     --authorizer-type NONE
   agentcore deploy
   ```

   After deployment, the `gatewayUrl` shown by **agentcore status** is the endpoint to use when you invoke the gateway.

1. Run `agentcore` to open the TUI, then select **add** and choose **Gateway** :

1. Enter the gateway name:  
![Gateway wizard: enter name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/images/tui/gateway-add-name.png)

1. Select **NONE** as the authorizer type and press **Enter** :  
![Gateway wizard: select NONE authorizer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/images/tui/gateway-add-auth-none.png)

1. Configure advanced options:  
![Gateway wizard: advanced configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/images/tui/gateway-add-advanced.png)

1. Review the configuration summary and press **Enter** to confirm:  
![Gateway wizard: review configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/images/tui/gateway-add-confirm.png)

1. Run the following code in a terminal to create a gateway with NONE authorizer type using the AWS CLI:

   ```
   aws bedrock-agentcore-control create-gateway \
     --name my-gateway \
     --role-arn arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/my-gateway-service-role \
     --protocol-type MCP \
     --authorizer-type NONE
   ```

   The `gatewayUrl` in the response is the endpoint to use when you invoke the gateway.

1. The following Python code shows how to create a gateway with NONE authorizer type using the AWS Python SDK (Boto3):

   ```
   import boto3
   
   # Initialize the AgentCore client
   client = boto3.client('bedrock-agentcore-control')
   
   # Create a gateway
   gateway = client.create_gateway(
     name="my-gateway",
     roleArn="arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/my-gateway-service-role",
     protocolType="MCP",
     authorizerType="NONE"
   )
   
   print(f"MCP Endpoint: {gateway['gatewayUrl']}")
   ```

## Create a gateway: basic example (AUTHENTICATE\_ONLY authorization)
<a name="gateway-create-ex-basic-authenticate-only"></a>

This section provides examples of creating a gateway with `AUTHENTICATE_ONLY` authorization. With this authorizer type, the gateway validates the inbound token but does not perform full authorization. The authenticated identity or token is then passed through to the target for downstream authorization. This is useful when you want the gateway to verify that the caller is authenticated while delegating authorization decisions to the target service.

**Note**  
The `AUTHENTICATE_ONLY` authorizer type requires a JWT authorizer configuration. The gateway validates the token but does not enforce scope or audience restrictions for authorization. If you choose an option that involves specifying an overt gateway service role ARN, ensure that you specify an existing one that you’ve set up. For more information, see [AgentCore Gateway service role permissions](gateway-prerequisites-permissions.md#gateway-service-role-permissions).

Select one of the following methods:

**Example**  

1. Run the following command to create a gateway with `AUTHENTICATE_ONLY` authorization:

   ```
   aws bedrock-agentcore-control create-gateway \
     --name my-gateway \
     --role-arn arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/my-gateway-service-role \
     --authorizer-type AUTHENTICATE_ONLY \
     --authorizer-configuration '{
       "jwtAuthenticationConfiguration": {
         "discoveryUrl": "https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/some-user-pool/.well-known/openid-configuration",
         "allowedClients": ["clientId"]
       }
     }'
   ```

   The `gatewayUrl` in the response is the endpoint to use when you invoke the gateway.

1. The following Python code shows how to create a gateway with `AUTHENTICATE_ONLY` authorization:

   ```
   import boto3
   
   # Initialize the AgentCore client
   client = boto3.client('bedrock-agentcore-control')
   
   # Create a gateway
   gateway = client.create_gateway(
     name="my-gateway",
     roleArn="arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/my-gateway-service-role",
     authorizerType="AUTHENTICATE_ONLY",
     authorizerConfiguration={
         "jwtAuthenticationConfiguration": {
             "discoveryUrl": "https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/some-user-pool/.well-known/openid-configuration",
             "allowedClients": ["clientId"]
         }
     }
   )
   
   print(f"Gateway URL: {gateway['gatewayUrl']}")
   ```

## Create a gateway with semantic search
<a name="gateway-create-ex-semantic"></a>

This section provides basic examples of creating a gateway with a tool to allow you to semantically search for relevant tools. To learn how to use this tool, see [Search for tools in your AgentCore gateway with a natural language query](gateway-using-mcp-semantic-search.md).

Select one of the following methods:

**Example**  

1. By default, semantic search is enabled when you create a gateway using the AgentCore CLI. To disable it, use the `--no-semantic-search` flag. To create a gateway with default semantic search enabled:

   ```
   agentcore add gateway --name my-gateway
   agentcore deploy
   ```

1. Run `agentcore` to open the TUI, then select **add** and choose **Gateway** . Semantic search is enabled by default in the advanced options:

1. Enter the gateway name:  
![Gateway wizard: enter name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/images/tui/gateway-add-name.png)

1. Select the authorizer type and press **Enter** :  
![Gateway wizard: select authorizer type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/images/tui/gateway-add-auth-jwt.png)

1. In advanced options, verify that semantic search is enabled (this is the default):  
![Gateway wizard: advanced configuration with semantic search enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/images/tui/gateway-add-advanced.png)

1. Review the configuration summary and press **Enter** to confirm:  
![Gateway wizard: review configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/images/tui/gateway-add-confirm.png)

1. Turn on semantic search when creating a gateway in the AWS CLI by specifying `searchType` as `SEMANTIC` in the `--protocol-configuration` object, as in the following example:

   ```
   aws bedrock-agentcore-control create-gateway \
     --name my-gateway \
     --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-gateway-service-role \
     --protocol-type MCP \
     --authorizer-type CUSTOM_JWT \
     --authorizer-configuration '{
       "customJWTAuthorizer": {
         "discoveryUrl": "https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/some-user-pool/.well-known/openid-configuration",
         "allowedClients": ["clientId"]
       }
     }' \
     --protocol-configuration '{
       "mcp": {
           "searchType": "SEMANTIC"
       }
     }'
   ```

   The `gatewayUrl` in the response is the endpoint to use when you invoke the gateway.

1. Turn on semantic search when creating a gateway using the AWS Python SDK (Boto3) by specifying `searchType` as `SEMANTIC` in the `protocolConfiguration` object, as in the following example:

   ```
   import boto3
   
   # Initialize the AgentCore client
   client = boto3.client('bedrock-agentcore-control')
   
   # Create a gateway
   gateway = client.create_gateway(
     name="my-gateway",
     roleArn="arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-gateway-service-role",
     protocolType="MCP",
     authorizerType="CUSTOM_JWT",
     authorizerConfiguration={
         "customJWTAuthorizer": {
             "discoveryUrl": "https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/some-user-pool/.well-known/openid-configuration",
             "allowedClients": ["clientId"]
         }
     },
     protocolConfiguration={
       "mcp": {
           "searchType": "SEMANTIC"
       }
     }
   )
   
   print(f"MCP Endpoint: {gateway['gatewayUrl']}")
   ```

## Create a gateway with debugging messages
<a name="gateway-create-ex-debug"></a>

You can create a gateway with debugging messages by specifying the `exceptionLevel` value as `DEBUG` . This section provides examples of creating a gateway with debugging messages. To learn more, see [Turn on debugging messages](gateway-debug-messages.md).

**Note**  
The AgentCore CLI does not set `exceptionLevel` to `DEBUG` by default. You must pass the `--exception-level DEBUG` flag when creating the gateway. You can turn off debugging messages by sending an [UpdateGateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore-control/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateGateway.html) request and omitting the `exceptionLevel` argument.

Select one of the following methods:

**Example**  

1. When you create a gateway using the AgentCore CLI, pass the `--exception-level` flag to enable debugging messages:

   ```
   agentcore add gateway --name my-gateway --exception-level DEBUG
   agentcore deploy
   ```

1. Run `agentcore` to open the TUI, then select **add** and choose **Gateway** . In advanced options, you can enable debugging messages by setting the exception level to `DEBUG` :

1. Enter the gateway name:  
![Gateway wizard: enter name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/images/tui/gateway-add-name.png)

1. Select the authorizer type and press **Enter** :  
![Gateway wizard: select authorizer type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/images/tui/gateway-add-auth-jwt.png)

1. In advanced options, set the exception level to `DEBUG` :  
![Gateway wizard: advanced configuration with debug mode enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/images/tui/gateway-add-advanced.png)

1. Review the configuration summary and press **Enter** to confirm:  
![Gateway wizard: review configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/images/tui/gateway-add-confirm.png)

1. Run the following code in a terminal to create a gateway with debugging messages turned on in the AWS CLI:

   ```
   aws bedrock-agentcore-control create-gateway \
     --name my-gateway \
     --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-gateway-service-role \
     --protocol-type MCP \
     --authorizer-type CUSTOM_JWT \
     --authorizer-configuration '{
       "customJWTAuthorizer": {
         "discoveryUrl": "https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/some-user-pool/.well-known/openid-configuration",
         "allowedClients": ["clientId"]
       }
     }' \
     --exception-level DEBUG
   ```

   The `gatewayUrl` in the response is the endpoint to use when you invoke the gateway.

1. The following Python code shows how to create a basic gateway with the AWS Python SDK (Boto3):

   ```
   import boto3
   
   # Initialize the AgentCore client
   client = boto3.client('bedrock-agentcore-control')
   
   # Create a gateway
   gateway = client.create_gateway(
     name="my-gateway",
     roleArn="arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-gateway-service-role",
     protocolType="MCP",
     authorizerType="CUSTOM_JWT",
     authorizerConfiguration={
         "customJWTAuthorizer": {
             "discoveryUrl": "https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/some-user-pool/.well-known/openid-configuration",
             "allowedClients": ["clientId"]
         }
     },
     exceptionLevel="DEBUG"
   )
   
   print(f"MCP Endpoint: {gateway['gatewayUrl']}")
   ```

## Create a gateway with interceptor configurations
<a name="gateway-create-ex-basic-interceptors"></a>

This section provides examples of creating a gateway that has interceptors configured. Interceptors will be invoked at runtime of the gateway for each request.

**Note**  
\* Interceptors will be invoked at runtime of the gateway for each request. \* If you choose an option that involves specifying an overt gateway service role ARN, ensure that you specify an existing one that you’ve set up. For more information, see [AgentCore Gateway service role permissions](gateway-prerequisites-permissions.md#gateway-service-role-permissions).

Select one of the following methods:

**Example**  

1. With the AgentCore CLI, first create the gateway and then configure interceptors using the AWS CLI or AWS Python SDK (Boto3).

   Create the gateway:

   ```
   agentcore add gateway \
     --name my-gateway \
     --authorizer-type CUSTOM_JWT \
     --discovery-url "https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/some-user-pool/.well-known/openid-configuration" \

   After the gateway is created and deployed, configure interceptors using the AWS CLI `update-gateway` command or the AWS Python SDK (Boto3) as shown in the other tabs.

1. Run the following code in a terminal to create a gateway with interceptor configurations using the AWS CLI:

   ```
   aws bedrock-agentcore-control create-gateway \
     --name my-gateway \
     --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-gateway-service-role \
     --protocol-type MCP \
     --authorizer-type CUSTOM_JWT \
     --authorizer-configuration '{
       "customJWTAuthorizer": {
         "discoveryUrl": "https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/some-user-pool/.well-known/openid-configuration",
         "allowedClients": ["clientId"]
       }
     }' \
     --interceptor-configurations '[{
         "interceptor": {
             "lambda": {
               "arn":"arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-interceptor-lambda"
             }
         },
         "interceptionPoints": ["REQUEST"]
     }]'
   ```

   The `gatewayUrl` in the response is the endpoint to use when you invoke the gateway.

1. The following Python code shows how to create a gateway with interceptor configurations using the AWS Python SDK (Boto3):

   ```
   import boto3
   
   # Initialize the AgentCore client
   client = boto3.client('bedrock-agentcore-control')
   
   # Create a gateway
   gateway = client.create_gateway(
     name="my-gateway",
     roleArn="arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-gateway-service-role",
     protocolType="MCP",
     authorizerType="CUSTOM_JWT",
     authorizerConfiguration={
         "customJWTAuthorizer": {
             "discoveryUrl": "https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/some-user-pool/.well-known/openid-configuration",
             "allowedClients": ["clientId"]
         }
     },
     interceptorConfigurations=[{
         "interceptor": {
             "lambda": {
               "arn":"arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-interceptor-lambda"
             }
         },
         "interceptionPoints": ["REQUEST"]
     }]
   )
   
   print(f"MCP Endpoint: {gateway['gatewayUrl']}")
   ```

## Create a gateway with a policy engine configuration
<a name="gateway-create-ex-policy-engine"></a>

You can create a gateway with a policy engine configuration. A policy engine is a collection of policies that evaluates and authorizes agent tool calls. When associated with a gateway, the policy engine intercepts all agent requests and determines whether to allow or deny each action based on the defined policies. The enforcement `mode` specifies whether to test policies ( `LOG_ONLY` ) or enforce them ( `ENFORCE` ).

**Example**  

1. First, add a policy engine to your project. Then, create a gateway that references the policy engine:

   ```
   agentcore add policy-engine \
     --name MyPolicyEngine
   
   agentcore add gateway \
     --name MyGateway \
     --authorizer-type CUSTOM_JWT \
     --discovery-url https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pool-id/.well-known/openid-configuration \
     --allowed-clients clientId \
     --policy-engine MyPolicyEngine \
     --policy-engine-mode LOG_ONLY
   
   agentcore deploy
   ```

   To enforce policies instead of only logging decisions, change `--policy-engine-mode` to `ENFORCE`.

1. Run the following command to create a gateway with a policy engine configuration using the AWS CLI:

   ```
   aws bedrock-agentcore-control create-gateway \
     --name my-gateway \
     --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-gateway-service-role \
     --protocol-type MCP \
     --authorizer-type CUSTOM_JWT \
     --authorizer-configuration '{
       "customJWTAuthorizer": {
         "discoveryUrl": "https://cognito-idp.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pool-id/.well-known/openid-configuration",
         "allowedClients": ["clientId"]
       }
     }' \
     --policy-engine-configuration '{
       "arn": "arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-west-2:123456789012:policy-engine/policy-id",
       "mode": "LOG_ONLY"
     }' \
     --exception-level DEBUG
   ```

   The `gatewayUrl` in the response is the endpoint to use when you invoke the gateway.
