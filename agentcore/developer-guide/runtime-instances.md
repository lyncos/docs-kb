# Runtime Instances and capacity providers
<a name="runtime-instances"></a>

The **Instances** compute type runs your agents on AWS managed Amazon EC2 infrastructure in your own AWS account, provisioned through a [capacity provider](runtime-instances-how-it-works.md#runtime-instances-capacity-provider). Because these instances run in your account, the security and encryption model differs from the serverless microVM compute type. The following topics describe the parts of that model:
+ The shared responsibility between you and AgentCore
+ The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles involved
+ Multi-tenant session isolation
+ How the Amazon EC2 resources are encrypted at rest
+ How you manage the data that Instances stores in your account

For a broader overview of the Instances compute type and how to use it, see [Instances](runtime-instances-how-it-works.md) and [Get started with Instances](runtime-instances-getting-started.md).
