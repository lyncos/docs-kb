# Diagnose AgentCore Evaluation issues with an AI coding assistant
<a name="diagnose-evaluation-issues"></a>

If your AgentCore Evaluation configuration isn’t producing results — or if you’re seeing errors like `LogEventMissingException`, `AgentSpanMappingException`, or empty evaluation scores — you can use the **AgentCore Evaluation Diagnostic Skill** to troubleshoot the issue yourself.

The skill is a markdown file that works with any AI coding assistant. You load it into your assistant, provide your AWS Region, deployment type, and optionally a session ID, and the assistant walks you through a step-by-step diagnosis. The skill works with agents deployed on AgentCore Runtime and agents hosted on third-party infrastructure (Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, AWS Lambda, or any other environment). The assistant queries your own Amazon CloudWatch log groups to identify the root cause and recommend a fix.

## What the skill diagnoses
<a name="what-the-skill-diagnoses"></a>

The skill covers the most common evaluation issues:
+  **Empty evaluation results** — no scores appear despite the evaluation configuration being enabled.
+  ** `LogEventMissingException` ** — the evaluation reports that a span is missing its corresponding log event.
+  ** `AgentSpanMappingException` ** or ** `ToolSpanMappingException` ** — the evaluation can’t extract the user query or tool output from a span.
+  ** `SpanEventParsingException` ** — the evaluation can’t parse an event’s body.
+  ** `Gateway Timeout (504)` ** — the evaluation times out.
+  ** `ValidationException` ** on `evaluatorId` — the evaluator ID format is incorrect.
+  **Multi-agent evaluation scoping issues** — evaluators target the wrong agent in a multi-agent trace.

## Prerequisites
<a name="diagnostic-skill-prerequisites"></a>
+  AWS CLI configured with credentials for the account where the agent runs. The credentials need the following permissions:
  +  `logs:DescribeLogGroups`, `logs:DescribeLogStreams`, `logs:StartQuery`, `logs:GetQueryResults` — to query CloudWatch Logs
  +  `bedrock-agentcore:GetOnlineEvaluationConfig`, `bedrock-agentcore:ListOnlineEvaluationConfigs` — to read evaluation configurations (online evaluation only)
+ Python 3.9 or later with the `boto3` library is recommended but not strictly required — the diagnostic queries can also be run via the AWS CLI directly.
+ An AI coding assistant that supports the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard or that can accept markdown instructions.
+ An agent that has been invoked at least once with observability enabled.

## Copy the skill
<a name="copy-the-skill"></a>

The skill source is available in [Diagnostic skill source](diagnose-evaluation-skill-source.md). Copy the entire code block from that topic and save it as `SKILL.md` inside a new folder named `agentcore-eval-diagnostic/` on your machine.

The skill is a plain markdown file. It contains only public information and runs only against your own account — no service-side access is required.

## Load the skill into your AI coding assistant
<a name="load-the-skill"></a>

Save the skill source from [Diagnostic skill source](diagnose-evaluation-skill-source.md) as `SKILL.md` inside a folder named `agentcore-eval-diagnostic/` on your machine, then move or copy that folder into the skills directory for your AI coding assistant. The skill follows the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard, so each tool discovers it from its own dedicated skills folder — do not append the skill contents to generic instruction files such as `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `GEMINI.md`.

### Kiro CLI
<a name="load-kiro"></a>

Place the skill folder at `.kiro/skills/agentcore-eval-diagnostic/` in your project, or at `~/.kiro/skills/agentcore-eval-diagnostic/` to make it available across all workspaces. For setup details, see the [Kiro CLI skills documentation](https://kiro.dev/docs/skills).

### Claude Code
<a name="load-claude-code"></a>

Place the skill folder at `.claude/skills/agentcore-eval-diagnostic/` in your project, or at `~/.claude/skills/agentcore-eval-diagnostic/` to make it available across all projects. For setup details, see the [Claude Code skills documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills).

### OpenAI Codex CLI
<a name="load-codex"></a>

Place the skill folder at `.agents/skills/agentcore-eval-diagnostic/` in your repository, or at `~/.agents/skills/agentcore-eval-diagnostic/` to make it available across all repositories. For setup details, see the [Codex CLI skills documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills).

### Cursor
<a name="load-cursor"></a>

Cursor uses Rules instead of skills. Save the skill contents as a project rule in `.cursor/rules/agentcore-eval-diagnostic.md`. For setup details, see the [Cursor Rules documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/context/rules).

### Gemini CLI
<a name="load-gemini-cli"></a>

Place the skill folder at `~/.gemini/skills/agentcore-eval-diagnostic/` to make it available across all workspaces, or in your project’s skills directory for project-scoped use. For setup details, see the [Gemini CLI skills documentation](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/skills/).

### Any other AI assistant
<a name="load-other"></a>

If your assistant supports the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard, place the skill folder in the directory your assistant uses to discover skills. If your assistant does not support Agent Skills, load the skill by pasting the contents of `SKILL.md` into a system prompt, user message, or context file. The skill is self-contained and does not depend on any tool-specific features.

## Run a diagnosis
<a name="run-a-diagnosis"></a>

After loading the skill, start a new chat with your AI assistant and provide:

1. Your AWS Region (for example, `us-west-2`).

1. Your deployment type — `agentcore-runtime` if your agent is deployed on AgentCore Runtime, or `3p-managed` if your agent is hosted on Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, AWS Lambda, or any other non-AgentCore environment.

1. Your evaluation type — `online` (uses an evaluation configuration with sampling) or `on-demand` (direct Evaluate API call).

1. Optionally, a session ID from your agent traces (the `session.id` attribute). If you don’t have one, the assistant can auto-discover recent sessions from your log groups.

The assistant queries your CloudWatch log groups, identifies the root cause of the failure, and produces a structured diagnostic report. The report includes:
+ A summary of the root cause.
+ A findings table showing which diagnostic checks passed or failed.
+ A list of affected spans and events.
+ Links to relevant AWS documentation.
+ Recommended next steps.

The assistant runs all queries in your own AWS account against your own CloudWatch log groups. It does not access any AWS service-side logs or internal data.

## Example interaction
<a name="example-interaction"></a>

 **You:** My Region is `us-west-2`, I’m using AgentCore Runtime with online evaluation, and my session ID is `my-session-abc123`. My evaluation isn’t producing results. Can you diagnose it?

 **AI assistant:** 

```
## AgentCore Evaluation Diagnostic Report

Session: my-session-abc123
Region: us-west-2

Summary: Service name mismatch — spans are emitted under
'my_agent.DEFAULT' but the evaluation configuration expects
'wrong_name.DEFAULT'.

Findings:
| Check                | Status | Details |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------- |
| Eval config status   | OK     | ENABLED, 100% sampling |
| Spans found          | OK     | 15 spans for this session |
| Scope support        | OK     | strands.telemetry.tracer found |
| Service name match   | FAIL   | Config expects wrong_name.DEFAULT |

Recommended fix: Update the evaluation configuration's serviceNames to
match 'my_agent.DEFAULT'.
```

## Troubleshooting the skill itself
<a name="troubleshooting-the-skill"></a>

If the assistant can’t query your log groups, check that:
+ Your AWS credentials have the required permissions.
+ The Region you provided matches where your agent is deployed.
+ The session ID is correct (copy it from your agent traces).
+ The agent has been invoked within the last 24 hours.
