# Prerequisites
<a name="insights-prerequisites"></a>

Before you begin using AgentCore insights, ensure you have the following:

**Topics**
+ [Requirements](#insights-prereqs-requirements)
+ [IAM permissions](#insights-prereqs-iam)
+ [Execution role](#insights-prereqs-execution-role)

## Requirements
<a name="insights-prereqs-requirements"></a>
+  ** AWS Account** with appropriate IAM permissions
+  **Amazon CloudWatch** access for reading agent session traces and viewing insight results
+  **Transaction Search** enabled in CloudWatch — see [AgentCore Observability](observability.md) for setup instructions
+  ** AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) SDK** instrumenting your agent — your agent must emit traces to CloudWatch Logs
+  **An active agent** with at least one completed session producing traces in CloudWatch Logs

## IAM permissions
<a name="insights-prereqs-iam"></a>

Your IAM user or role needs the following permissions to configure and run insights:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",		 	 	 
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "bedrock-agentcore:CreateOnlineEvaluationConfig",
                "bedrock-agentcore:GetOnlineEvaluationConfig",
                "bedrock-agentcore:ListOnlineEvaluationConfigs",
                "bedrock-agentcore:UpdateOnlineEvaluationConfig",
                "bedrock-agentcore:DeleteOnlineEvaluationConfig",
                "bedrock-agentcore:StartBatchEvaluation",
                "bedrock-agentcore:GetBatchEvaluation",
                "bedrock-agentcore:ListBatchEvaluations"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Execution role
<a name="insights-prereqs-execution-role"></a>

The online evaluation configuration requires an execution role (`evaluationExecutionRoleArn`) that allows the service to:
+ Read traces from CloudWatch Logs
+ Invoke Amazon Bedrock models for insight analysis
+ Store and retrieve insight results

If you have already configured an execution role for AgentCore Evaluations, the same role works for insights. See [Evaluations Prerequisites](evaluations-prerequisites.md) for details on creating this role.

**Note**  
If you plan to use insights findings to generate optimized configurations through [AgentCore optimization recommendations](optimization-recommendations.md), you also need `bedrock-agentcore:StartRecommendation`, `bedrock-agentcore:GetRecommendation`, `bedrock-agentcore:ListRecommendations`, and `bedrock-agentcore:DeleteRecommendation` permissions. See [Optimization Prerequisites](optimization-prereqs.md) for details.
