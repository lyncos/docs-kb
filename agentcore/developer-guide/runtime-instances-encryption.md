# Encryption at rest for Runtime Instances
<a name="runtime-instances-encryption"></a>

When you host agents on the **Instances** compute type, your data at rest lives on the Amazon EBS volumes that a capacity provider attaches to your sessions. Amazon EBS creates these volumes in your own AWS account, so EBS encryption protects them.

A session uses three kinds of volume, and EBS encryption protects all of them:
+  **Root volume** – The instance boot volume, configured through `rootVolume`. It is ephemeral: AgentCore deletes it when the instance terminates.
+  **Ephemeral volumes** – Storage that lasts only as long as the instance. AgentCore deletes these when the instance terminates.
+  **Persistent volumes** – Named volumes that you define in `volumes`. They survive instance termination and persist until you delete the session. A capacity provider can define up to five.

Only persistent volumes keep your data across a session stop. Treat anything written to the root volume or an ephemeral volume as temporary.

## Options for encryption at rest
<a name="runtime-instances-encryption-options"></a>

By default, Instances relies on the [Amazon EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption.html) setting of your AWS account. If you enable EBS encryption by default in a Region, the volumes that your capacity providers create in that Region are encrypted with the default key you configured, with no additional configuration on the capacity provider.

You can also provide a customer managed AWS KMS key on the capacity provider’s volume configuration. Use a customer managed key when you need to control or audit the key that protects your volumes. With a customer managed key you can rotate the key on your own schedule, control access to it through key policies, and audit its use through AWS CloudTrail.

## Encrypting capacity provider volumes with a customer managed KMS key
<a name="runtime-instances-encryption-cmk"></a>

A capacity provider defines its persistent storage as EBS volume configurations. Each volume configuration accepts an `encrypted` flag and a `kmsKeyId`. When AgentCore creates the volume on the session’s first launch, EBS encrypts it with the key you specified. EBS encryption uses symmetric KMS keys.

A volume configuration also accepts an optional `snapshotId`. AgentCore initializes the volume from that snapshot the first time it creates the volume. With this behavior, you can start a session from a prepared dataset. On later restarts, AgentCore reuses the existing volume and ignores the snapshot. You can’t take a snapshot of a capacity provider volume, because AgentCore creates and operates these volumes as managed resources. For information about exporting data from a volume, see [Manage your data on Runtime Instances](runtime-instances-data-management.md).

### Configuring permissions to use a customer managed KMS key
<a name="runtime-instances-encryption-permissions"></a>

Two principals need permissions on the key:
+  **The principal that calls `CreateCapacityProvider` ** must be able to call `kms:DescribeKey` on each key that you pass in a volume configuration. AgentCore uses this to validate the key when it creates the capacity provider.
+  **The capacity provider operator role** must be able to use the key to create encrypted EBS volumes. For the KMS permissions that EBS requires to create and attach encrypted volumes, see [Requirements for Amazon EBS encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-encryption-requirements.html) in the Amazon EBS User Guide.

### Creating a capacity provider with a customer managed KMS key
<a name="runtime-instances-encryption-create"></a>

Specify `encrypted` and `kmsKeyId` in the volume’s `ebsConfiguration` when you create the capacity provider:

```
aws bedrock-agentcore-control create-capacity-provider \
  --name "my-encrypted-capacity-provider" \
  --permissions-configuration '{"capacityProviderOperatorRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/CapacityProviderOperatorRole"}' \
  --compute-configuration '{
    "ec2Configuration": {
      "launchTemplateSource": {
        "launchParameters": {
          "operatingSystem": "LINUX_X86_64",
          "instanceRequirements": { "allowedInstanceTypes": ["m5.large"] }
        }
      },
      "vpcConfiguration": {
        "subnets": ["subnet-0123456789abcdef0"],
        "securityGroups": ["sg-0123456789abcdef0"]
      },
      "volumes": [
        {
          "ebsConfiguration": {
            "name": "scratch",
            "sizeGiB": 50,
            "volumeType": "gp3",
            "encrypted": true,
            "kmsKeyId": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

### Changing the encryption configuration
<a name="runtime-instances-encryption-change"></a>

After a capacity provider is created, only its description can be edited. To use a different key or change the encryption settings, create a new capacity provider with the updated volume configuration and associate your runtimes with it. Existing volumes keep the encryption configuration they were created with.

## Monitoring key use
<a name="runtime-instances-encryption-monitoring"></a>

 AWS CloudTrail logs the KMS API calls made against your customer managed key when EBS creates and attaches encrypted volumes for your sessions. For more information, see [Logging AWS KMS API calls with AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html#searching-kms-ct) in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
