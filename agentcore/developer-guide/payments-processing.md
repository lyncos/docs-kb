# Processing payments
<a name="payments-processing"></a>

After you complete the control plane setup, use the following workflows to create instruments, sessions, and process payments.

**Tip**  
You can automate the steps on this page with the AgentCore Payments skill in the AWS agent toolkit. The skill is part of the **aws-agents** plugin and lets an AI coding agent create your Payment Manager, connector, credential provider, payment instrument, and session using the `agentcore` CLI, and add a process payment tool to your agent. For details, see the [quickstart](payments-getting-started.md) and the [AWS agent toolkit on GitHub](https://github.com/aws/agent-toolkit-for-aws/tree/main).
