# Code examples
<a name="runtime-bidirectional-streaming-examples"></a>

The following sample applications demonstrate bidirectional streaming on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime.

## WebSocket examples
<a name="runtime-streaming-examples-websocket"></a>

Bidirectional WebSocket samples (Sonic, Strands, Echo)  
Three WebSocket examples for AgentCore Runtime: a native Amazon Nova Sonic implementation with direct event handling and a web client, a Strands Agents SDK voice agent using the Strands WebSocket transport, and a minimal echo server for testing bidirectional streaming. See [Bidirectional WebSocket samples](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-bedrock-agentcore-samples/tree/main/01-features/02-host-your-agent/01-runtime/03-advanced/03-bidirectional-streaming) on GitHub.

Pipecat voice agent with WebSocket  
Deploys a Pipecat voice agent to AgentCore Runtime using WebSocket for bidirectional audio streaming. The pipeline orchestrates Deepgram (speech-to-text), Amazon Nova (LLM), and Cartesia (text-to-speech). See [Pipecat on AgentCore with WebSocket](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat-examples/tree/main/deployment/aws-agentcore-websocket) on GitHub.

Serverless telephony with Vonage and Amazon Nova Sonic  
A serverless contact center agent that handles phone calls through the Vonage Voice API, processing audio in real-time with Amazon Nova Sonic over AgentCore Runtime WebSocket connections. Uses a Lambda function to generate presigned WebSocket URLs for Vonage. See [Serverless telephony with Sonic and AgentCore Runtime](https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-vonage-serverless-sonic) on GitHub.

## WebRTC examples
<a name="runtime-streaming-examples-webrtc"></a>

WebRTC voice agent with KVS TURN  
A minimal WebRTC voice agent using Amazon Kinesis Video Streams for TURN relaying and an Amazon Bedrock foundation model for speech-to-speech conversation. See [WebRTC voice agent with KVS TURN](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-bedrock-agentcore-samples/tree/main/01-features/02-host-your-agent/01-runtime/03-advanced/03-bidirectional-streaming/05-bidirectional-streaming-webrtc) on GitHub.

Pipecat voice agent with WebRTC  
Deploys a Pipecat voice agent to AgentCore Runtime using SmallWebRTC as a lightweight WebRTC transport. The pipeline orchestrates Deepgram (speech-to-text), Amazon Nova (LLM), and Cartesia (text-to-speech). See [Pipecat on AgentCore with WebRTC](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat-examples/tree/main/deployment/aws-agentcore-webrtc) on GitHub.

Pipecat voice agent with Daily  
Deploys a Pipecat voice agent to AgentCore Runtime using Daily as the WebRTC transport. Users join by visiting a Daily room URL in their browser. The pipeline orchestrates Deepgram (speech-to-text), Amazon Nova (LLM), and Cartesia (text-to-speech). See [Pipecat on AgentCore with Daily](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat-examples/tree/main/deployment/aws-agentcore-daily) on GitHub.

LiveKit voice agent on AgentCore Runtime  
Deploys a LiveKit voice agent to AgentCore Runtime with KVS managed TURN or third-party TURN for WebRTC NAT traversal. See [LiveKit on AgentCore Runtime](https://github.com/awslabs/agentcore-samples/tree/main/03-integrations/agentic-frameworks/livekit) on GitHub.
