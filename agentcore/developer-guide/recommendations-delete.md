# Delete recommendation
<a name="recommendations-delete"></a>

Delete a recommendation and its associated metadata. The recommendation must be in a terminal state (`COMPLETED` or `FAILED`) before it can be deleted.

Deleting a recommendation removes the record from `ListRecommendations`. It does not affect any configuration bundle versions that were created as part of the recommendation result.

## Code samples
<a name="delete-rec-examples"></a>

**Example**  

```
import boto3

client = boto3.client("bedrock-agentcore", region_name="us-west-2")

response = client.delete_recommendation(
    recommendationId="MyPromptRec-Ab1Cd2Ef3G"
)
print(f"Deleted: {response['recommendationId']}")
print(f"Status: {response['status']}")
```

```
agentcore archive recommendation -i MyPromptRec-Ab1Cd2Ef3G
```
The recommendation must be in a terminal state (`COMPLETED` or `FAILED`). This command archives the recommendation job record on the service and clears local history.
