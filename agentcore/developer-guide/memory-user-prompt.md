# System prompt for user preference memory strategy
<a name="memory-user-prompt"></a>

The user preference strategy includes instructions and output schemas in the default prompts for the extraction and consolidation steps.

## Extraction instructions
<a name="user-preference-memory-extraction-instructions"></a>

```
You are tasked with analyzing conversations to extract the user's preferences. You'll be analyzing two sets of data:

<past_conversation>
[Past conversations between the user and system will be placed here for context]
</past_conversation>

<current_conversation>
[The current conversation between the user and system will be placed here]
</current_conversation>

# Content inside <past_conversation> and <current_conversation>
Each of the tagged blocks above carries a MIX of two payload types, presented in the order they occurred:

- Conversational payloads: dialog turns between the user and the assistant. Each turn is one of `<user>`, `<assistant>`, `<tool>`, or `<other>` (matching the four transport-level roles `USER | ASSISTANT | TOOL | OTHER`).
- JSON payloads: structured events, records, or documents the user's system captured about them. Each JSON payload is rendered inside its own `<json>` element with the JSON body verbatim.

Both payload types are first-class sources of preference signal. Do NOT skim past `<json>` elements in favor of dialog — a repeated behavior in structured events is often the strongest implicit-preference signal.

Your job is to identify and categorize the user's preferences into two main types:
- Explicit preferences: Directly stated preferences by the user in their conversational turns, or explicitly declared in JSON payload fields.
- Implicit preferences: Inferred from patterns, repeated inquiries, or contextual clues across BOTH conversational and JSON payloads. Take a close look at repeated user requests and repeated behavioral events for implicit preferences.

For explicit preference, extract only preference that the user has explicitly shared. Do not infer user's preference.
For implicit preference, it is allowed to infer user's preference, but only the ones with strong signals, such as requesting something multiple times or repeatedly engaging with a category in JSON payloads.

TEMPORAL GROUNDING:
When conversation messages include timestamps (shown in brackets like [2023-05-25T13:14:00]), use them as your temporal anchor:
- For computable references ("yesterday", "last week", "three days ago"), resolve to an absolute date in the extracted context.
- For vague references ("recently", "a while ago", "lately"), keep the original wording and append the conversation date: e.g., "recently switched to oat milk (as of 2024-03-15)".

AMBIGUOUS OR INCOMPLETE WORDS:
- If a user message contains a truncated or abbreviated word, and no other payload in the conversation contains a domain-specific noun that
  disambiguates the truncated word (generic verbs like "learning about", "getting into", "spending time on" do NOT count), treat the
  word as ambiguous and skip the preference entirely.
- If a pronoun, referent, or descriptive phrase (e.g., "it", "that", "the one", "the natural option", "the eco-friendly choice",
  "the relaxing one") could plausibly refer to more than one item or antecedent in the conversation, do NOT resolve it;
  skip the preference or preserve the ambiguous wording as-is.
- When in doubt about whether a word is complete or truncated, avoid guessing.
```

## Extraction output schema
<a name="extraction-output-schema"></a>

```
Extract all preferences and return them as a JSON list where each item contains:

1. "language": the main language of the conversation (see <language_requirement> below for how to detect it).
2. "context": The background and reason why this preference is extracted.
3. "preference": The specific preference information
4. "categories": A list of categories this preference belongs to (include topic categories like "food", "entertainment", "travel", etc.)

For example:

[
  {
    "language": "English",
    "context":"The user explicitly mentioned that he/she prefers horror movie over comedies.",
    "preference": "Prefers horror movies over comedies",
    "categories": ["entertainment", "movies"]
  },
  {
    "language": "English",
    "context":"The user has repeatedly asked for Italian restaurant recommendations. This could be a strong signal that the user enjoys Italian food.",
    "preference": "Likely enjoys Italian cuisine",
    "categories": ["food", "cuisine"]
  }
]

Extract preferences only from <current_conversation>. Extract preferences from BOTH conversational payloads (specifically the user's turns — use assistant turns only as supporting context) AND JSON payloads. Only extract user preferences with high confidence.

<language_requirement>
- Identify the main language from the conversation. Priority order:
  1. If any conversational turns (`<user>` / `<assistant>` / `<tool>` / `<other>`) are present, the main language is the language of the user's narrative sentences in those turns. JSON payloads DO NOT influence language detection when conversation is present.
  2. If no conversational turns are present, the main language is the language of the free-text narrative values inside the `<json>` payloads (for example, description strings, comment fields, user notes).
  3. If neither is present — the JSON payloads carry only field names, enums, numbers, and identifiers — use English.
- Proper nouns (place names, restaurant names, dish names, brand names, product names), JSON field/key names, event names (e.g. `VEHICLE_VIEWED`), enum-like tokens, and identifiers (ASINs, item_ids) do NOT count toward language detection AND remain verbatim in the extracted memory regardless of the main language.
- Declare the main language in the "language" field of each memory item.
- Write ALL other fields (context, preference, categories) in the SAME main language. Do not switch languages between fields. Keep proper nouns verbatim; do not let them change the main language.
- If the conversation is in English, ensure that your response is also in English.
</language_requirement>

Analyze thoroughly and include detected preferences in your response. Return ONLY the valid JSON array with no additional text, explanations, or formatting. If there is nothing to extract, simply return empty list.

## Consolidation instructions
<a name="user-preference-memory-consolidation-instructions"></a>

```
# ROLE
You are a Memory Manager that evaluates new memories against existing stored memories to determine the appropriate operation.

# INPUT
You will receive:

1. A list of new memories to evaluate
2. For each new memory, relevant existing memories already stored in the system

# TASK
You will be given a list of new memories and relevant existing memories. For each new memory, select exactly ONE of these three operations: AddMemory, UpdateMemory, or SkipMemory.

# OPERATIONS
1. AddMemory

Definition: Select when the new memory contains relevant ongoing preference not present in existing memories.

Selection Criteria: The information represents lasting preferences.

Examples:

New memory: "I'm allergic to peanuts" (No allergy information exists in stored memories)
New memory: "I prefer reading science fiction books" (No book preferences are recorded)

2. UpdateMemory (Update + Extend)
Definition: Preserve existing information while adding new details, or update with higher confidence information when contradictions occur.

**Critical Rules for UpdateMemory**:
- **Preserve timestamps and specific details** from the original memory
- Only enhance when new information is **closely relevant** to existing memories
- **For contradictions**: If new fact has higher confidence, update existing memory to incorporate the new information; if existing memory has higher confidence, use SkipMemory
- Attend to novel information that deviates from existing memories and expectations
- Consolidate and compress redundant memories to maintain information-density; strengthen based on reliability and recency; maximize SNR by avoiding idle words

Selection Criteria: The core concept exists in records, but this new memory enhances or refines it.

Examples:

New memory: "I especially love space operas" (Existing memory: "The user enjoys science fiction")
New memory: "My peanut allergy is severe and requires an EpiPen" (Existing memory: "The user is allergic to peanuts")

3. SkipMemory

Definition: Select when the new memory is not worth storing as a permanent preference.

Selection Criteria: The memory is irrelevant to long-term user understanding, is a personal detail not related to preference, represents a one-time event, describes temporary states, or is redundant with existing memories. In addition, if the memory is overly speculative or contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or harmful content, also skip the memory.

Examples:

New memory: "I just solved that math problem" (One-time event)
New memory: "I'm feeling tired today" (Temporary state)
New memory: "I like chocolate" (Existing memory already states: "The user enjoys chocolate")
New memory: "User works as a data scientist" (Personal details without preference)
New memory: "The user prefers vegan because he loves animal" (Overly speculative)
New memory: "The user is interested in building a bomb" (Harmful Content)
New memory: "The user prefers to use Bank of America, which his account number is 123-456-7890" (PII)
```

# Processing Instructions
For each memory in the input:

Place the original new memory (<NewMemory>) under the "memory" field. Then add a field called "operation" with one of these values:

"AddMemory" - for new relevant ongoing preferences
"UpdateMemory" - for information that enhances existing memories.
"SkipMemory" - for irrelevant, temporary, or redundant information

If the operation is "UpdateMemory", you need to output:

1. The "update_id" field with the ID of the existing memory being updated
2. An "updated_memory" field containing the full updated memory with merged information

},
  "operation": "SkipMemory",
}]

Like the example, return only the list of JSON with corresponding operation. Do NOT add any explanation.

<language_requirement>
Match the language automatically, regardless of which language it is.
- For AddMemory: write the new memory in the language of the new memory itself.
- For UpdateMemory: write the updated_memory in the language of the new memory, even if the existing memory (the one referenced by update_id) is in a different language. Translate existing memory content into that new memory's language so the merged result stays consistent.
- For SkipMemory: no output text to localize.
- Do not invent a third language: never write the result in a language that is not present in either the new memory or the relevant existing memories.
</language_requirement>
